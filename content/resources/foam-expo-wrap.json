How could there possibly be a show solely dedicated to foam?For those of you who don’t know, the foam industry is filled with incredible products from a wide variety of industries that is chalked full of ingenuity and imagination. From raw foam materials to home insulation, automotive seats and steering wheels, footwear, pillows, bedding, and way beyond.The foam expo was not only a chance for us to catch up with material suppliers and competitors, but also a chance for us to learn more about the foam industry as a whole. Believe me when I say this, it was much more than we expected, and we can’t wait to exhibit at the expo again next year.Thank you to all who came to visit booth #323 if you attended the show.  We are here to service you in any way we can. Our sales team and engineers are ready to assist you with any new or existing project you may have.Feel free to call us at 847.593.5630, or email us at info@srpco.com.Team SRP","description":null,"type":"resource","collectionType":"resources","order":0,"youtube":null,"resourceType":"article","media":{},"seo":{"id":3259,"title":"Foam Expo Wrap-Up","description":null,"image":{}},"blocks":[],"pageSettings":null,"id":35}
