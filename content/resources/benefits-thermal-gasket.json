Though often overlooked, these gaskets are a key component to the successful function of many products used daily. At Standard Rubber Products Co. (SRP), we have been assisting customers since 1951 by providing custom die cut solutions to help solve various types of thermal application issues.</p>\n<h4><strong>What is a Gasket?</strong></h4>\n<p>Gaskets are specifically designed to serve as a buffer between components. These parts provide several benefits to not only the finished product, but to the end user as well. One of the design features of a gasket is to prevent leakage. The intention is to prevent fluids from leaking out of the component. However, these seals can also prevent outside forces such as dust, dirt, and rain from getting into the application.</p>\n<p>Specifically designed seals also work to reduce squeaks, rattles or vibrations that are being generated by providing a cushion or pad to absorb that energy. This buffer reduces wear and tear, which in turn works to extend the lifespan and quality of a product.</p>\n<h4><strong>Thermal Gasket Fabrication</strong></h4>\n<p>Thermal gaskets are specific components which are designed to function in areas that generate high temperatures. They are fabricated in a number of ways. They can be both die and dieless cut from thermal interface materials, gap pads, and filler pads.</p>\n<p>Advances in technology have enabled expert teams such as ours at SRP to work closely with our customers to design the products they need. With an increase in demand and a streamline of processes, our facilities can enable companies to take their gasket needs from their conceptual origins through mass production.</p>\n<p>With custom designs to fit specific intended needs, <a href=\"https://www.srpco.com/applications/thermal-management\">thermal gaskets</a> provide efficient support for both industrial operations and consumer goods. Industries around the world realize that these items are necessary for the prolonged life of various industrial and consumer products. When it comes to thermal management, you can count on SRP to manufacture the right gasket for you.</p>\n","description":null,"type":"resource","collectionType":"resources","order":0,"youtube":null,"resourceType":"article","media":{},"seo":{"id":3266,"title":"The Benefits of a Thermal Gasket","description":null,"image":{}},"blocks":[],"pageSettings":null,"id":42}
