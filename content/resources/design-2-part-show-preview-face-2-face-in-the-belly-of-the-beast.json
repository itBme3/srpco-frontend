Most recently, we have been focusing our marketing and sales efforts on companies who are designing and manufacturing products nearby. Elk Grove Village has gone through great lengths to bring manufacturing back to the area, and SRP is very pleased with their efforts.</p>\n<p>“The Midwest area is heavily occupied by manufacturing companies seeking out custom gasket fabrication and <a href=\"https://www.srpco.com/\">die-cutting</a> services”, says Eric Schmid, Sales Engineer at SRP. He continues, “the Design-2-Part show allows us to be face-to-face with the engineers and buyers from many of these companies to showcase what we have to offer.”</p>\n<p>Building a relationship with our customers is a priority, and we feel that meeting face-to-face is a big first step in the right direction. If you are planning to attend the show, SRP will be in booth #316. Come on by and ask us how we can assist you on your next custom die-cut project.</p>\n<p>For more information about the show, you can check out the show’s <a href=\"https://www.d2p.com/2018-chicago-manufacturing-trade-show\">homepage</a>.</p>\n","description":null,"type":"resource","collectionType":"resources","order":0,"youtube":null,"resourceType":"article","media":{},"seo":{"id":3247,"title":"Design-2-Part Show Preview: Face-2-Face in the Belly of the Beast","description":null,"image":{}},"blocks":[],"pageSettings":null,"id":23}
