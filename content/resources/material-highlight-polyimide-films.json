{"title":"Material Highlight: Polyimide Films","slug":"material-highlight-polyimide-films","type":"resource","collectionType":"resources","content":"<h3><strong>What Are They?</strong></h3>\n<p>Polyimide films are anything but ordinary. These films are engineered for long-term performance at extreme temperatures between -450° F to over 500° F over extended periods of time. So, obviously, thermal stability is a major benefit, which is why this film is so widely used in aerospace, electronics, and electrical industries when a high temperature material is required. Polyimide films possess a unique combination of properties that make it ideal for a variety of applications in a variety of different industries.</p>\n<h4><strong>Features and benefits:</strong></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/srp-media/image/upload/v1650820378/Full_Size_Render_3_1_1f9a831cc6.jpg\" style=\"height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 300px\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability of these films to maintain their tremendous physical, electrical, and mechanical properties over a wide temperature range immensely reduces the need for rework, helping to enable high productivity out of this product.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Dimensionally stable at high temperatures, which helps reduce rework, helping to enable high productivity.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Flame retardant, chemical and radiation resistant which helps protect surfaces to help reduce replacement costs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Popular Polyimide Products</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>Kapton® Polyimide Films</strong></h4>\n<p>DuPont™ Kapton® polyimide films have set the industry standard for over 45 years in high performance, reliability and durability, with a unique combination of electrical, thermal, chemical and mechanical properties that withstand extreme temperature, vibration and other demanding environments.</p>\n<p><strong><a title=\" DuPont™ Kapton®\" href=\"https://www.srpco.com/sites/default/files/DuPont%20Kapton%20Polyimide.pdf\">Click Here</a></strong> to view the official data sheet for Kapton®.</p>\n<h4><strong>3M™ Polyimide Film Tape</strong><strong> </strong></h4>\n<p>3M™ Polyimide Film Tape 5413 with DuPont™ Kapton® polyimide film and silicone adhesive is used for PCB solder masking and other high temperature applications. This product is amber colored and 2.7 mil (69 microns) thick.</p>\n<p><strong><a title=\"3M™ Polyimide Film Tape \" href=\"https://www.srpco.com/sites/default/files/3M%20Polyimide%20Film%20Tape.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click Here</a></strong> to view the official data sheet for this product.</p>\n<h3><strong>Common Applications using Polyimide Films </strong></h3>\n<p>Polyimide films can be used in a variety of electrical and electronic insulation applications including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wire and cable tapes</li>\n<li>Substrates for flexible printed circuits</li>\n<li>Motor slot liners</li>\n<li>Transformer and capacitor insulation</li>\n<li>Magnetic and pressure-sensitive tapes</li>\n<li>Dielectric Gaskets</li>\n<li>Thermal Barriers</li>\n<li>Heat Sink Pads</li>\n<li>Automotive Sensors</li>\n<li>Circuit Board Insulation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Polyimide films are a highly convertible material, making it easy for us to custom fabricate.
