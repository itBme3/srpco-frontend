These films are engineered for long-term performance at extreme temperatures between -450° F to over 500° F over extended periods of time. So, obviously, thermal stability is a major benefit, which is why this film is so widely used in aerospace, electronics, and electrical industries when a high temperature material is required. Polyimide films possess a unique combination of properties that make it ideal for a variety of applications in a variety of different industries.Features and benefits:The ability of these films to maintain their tremendous physical, electrical, and mechanical properties over a wide temperature range immensely reduces the need for rework, helping to enable high productivity out of this product.Dimensionally stable at high temperatures, which helps reduce rework, helping to enable high productivity.Flame retardant, chemical and radiation resistant which helps protect surfaces to help reduce replacement costs.Popular Polyimide ProductsKapton® Polyimide FilmsDuPont™ Kapton® polyimide films have set the industry standard for over 45 years in high performance, reliability and durability, with a unique combination of electrical, thermal, chemical and mechanical properties that withstand extreme temperature, vibration and other demanding environments.Click Here to view the official data sheet for Kapton®.3M™ Polyimide Film Tape 3M™ Polyimide Film Tape 5413 with DuPont™ Kapton® polyimide film and silicone adhesive is used for PCB solder masking and other high temperature applications. This product is amber colored and 2.7 mil (69 microns) thick.Click Here to view the official data sheet for this product.Common Applications using Polyimide Films Polyimide films can be used in a variety of electrical and electronic insulation applications including:Wire and cable tapesSubstrates for flexible printed circuitsMotor slot linersTransformer and capacitor insulationMagnetic and pressure-sensitive tapesDielectric GasketsThermal BarriersHeat Sink PadsAutomotive SensorsCircuit Board InsulationPolyimide films are a highly convertible material, making it easy for us to custom fabricate.
