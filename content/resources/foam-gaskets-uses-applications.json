Available in Polyurethane, Neoprene, EPDM and silicone, SRP can custom design and die cut <a href=\"https://www.srpco.com/gaskets/foam-gaskets/\">foam gaskets</a> to create a seal that’s compatible with the application.</p>\n<h3><strong>Common applications for foam gaskets:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Gasketing</li>\n<li>Cushioning</li>\n<li>Sealing</li>\n<li>Mounting</li>\n<li>Insulation</li>\n<li>Noise reduction</li>\n<li>Vibration control</li>\n<li>Electrical absorption</li>\n<li>Fluid restriction</li>\n<li>Weather resistance</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Foam gaskets can be applied to wide range of <strong>industries</strong>. Some of these include:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Appliance</li>\n<li>Automotive</li>\n<li>HVAC</li>\n<li>Medical</li>\n<li>Electronic</li>\n<li>Lighting</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Open cell vs. closed cell foam gaskets</h3>\n<p>Foam gasket material comes in a range of cell structures, from open cell to closed cell. Open cell foam gaskets are primarily used for shock or vibration applications. Closed cell foam gaskets are used primarily for environmental seals where the material would be exposed to challenging outdoor conditions, such as sunlight, dust, cold and moisture.</p>\n<h3>Types of foam gaskets</h3>\n<p>As you choose a foam gasket material, it’s important to make sure it can stand up to the environment and media it will be exposed to, including temperature, moisture, UV rays, chemicals and solvents. The following can help you get started in narrowing your selection.</p>\n<h3>Silicone foam gaskets</h3>\n<p>Silicone foam is a pliable, flexible, high-performance material that’s extremely versatile, providing many solutions across a wide berth of products and industries. Silicone foam provides excellent electrical insulation, is an effective flame retardant and it’s a <a href=\"https://www.srpco.com/gaskets/custom-high-temperature-gasket/\">high-temperature gasket</a> material in comparison to Neoprene and EPDM. In terms of durability, silicone foam has good tensile strength and excellent compression set, it maintains flexibility in cold temperatures and resists UV rays.</p>\n<h4>Silicone foam is used in these industries:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Electronics</li>\n<li>Industrial</li>\n<li>Aerospace</li>\n<li>Construction</li>\n<li>Automotive</li>\n<li>Medical</li>\n<li>Consumer products</li>\n<li>HVAC</li>\n</ul>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>EPDM foam gaskets</h3>\n<p>EPDM foam is a versatile, all-purpose material that has several unique applications in several industries. Available in closed cell or semi-closed cell, it maintains its pliability even after prolonged exposure to environmental conditions. It also has a good compression set, reverting to its original shape after pressure and stretching. Along with hot temperature resistance, up to 220 F, it has excellent water resistance, and is best suited for wet and steamy conditions compared to other foams. EPDM foam is an excellent material for blocking electrical interference, offering protection to electrical components and the end users.</p>\n<h4>Top industries for EPDM foam gaskets:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Appliances</li>\n<li>HVAC</li>\n<li>Electrical</li>\n<li>Construction</li>\n<li>Automotive</li>\n</ul>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Closed Cell Neoprene foam gaskets</h3>\n<p>Closed Cell Neoprene foam gaskets are the go-to as a form-fitting, pliable but long-lasting seal for electrical components. Because Neoprene is resistant to UV rays, heat, cold and moisture, it is effective at sealing out the elements, as well as any dust and dirt. Neoprene foam’s resistance to oils, refrigerants and many chemicals makes it well suited for electronic applications. Neoprene foam is also effective at absorbing sound and vibration. When fastened with an adhesive backing, it’s an effective solution for unwanted noise and buzzing.</p>\n<h4>Top industries for closed cell Neoprene foam gaskets:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Appliances</li>\n<li>HVAC</li>\n<li>Electrical</li>\n<li>Construction</li>\n<li>Automotive</li>\n</ul>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>SRP’s Custom Foam Gasket Manufacturing</h3>\n<p>Our sponge and foam gasket fabrication services can include more than supplying you with the foam gasket you need.
