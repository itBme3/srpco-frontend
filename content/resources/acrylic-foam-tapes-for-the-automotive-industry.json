NO WELDS. NO RIVETS.</h2>\n<p>We are living in a time when automobiles are constantly changing. Not just the design, but the way they are manufactured. The system in which automobiles are being produced is also evolving.</p>\n<p>With technology evolving at a rapid rate, manufacturing and assembly of automobiles is becoming more and more efficient every year. Whether it’s automation or manual assembly, companies are looking for the next method to increase speed and reduce expenses without sacrificing safety.</p>\n<p>It has long been known that the use of fasteners, welds and rivets is becoming obsolete for interior and exterior applications in automotive and recreational vehicles. They simply do not provide the performance, aesthetics or ease of installation compared to the competition.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>AUTOMOTIVE FOAM TAPE: YOUR BEST BET</h2>\n<p><strong>Enter foam tapes</strong> as your solution to rivets, screws and welds. <a href=\"https://www.srpco.com/materials/3madhesivetapes/\">Foam tapes</a> are not a new technology. In fact, they have been around for decades. What is new, however, are emerging applications for foam tapes. As foam tapes evolve, they find their way into new industries for different uses, including sealing gaskets for electronics, attaching glass panels to skyscrapers, and bonding nameplates and logos to various substrates.</p>\n<p>Because acrylic foam tape eliminates the need for fasteners, welds and rivets, it can transform the performance, efficiency and price for a variety of applications.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Benefits of automotive foam tapes by 3M</h2>\n<p>Acrylic foam tape from 3M is more than just a tape. Decades of <strong>sophisticated engineering have resulted in a standard-bearing bonding system</strong> designed to create a <strong>strong, enduring bond</strong> that resists degradation from environmental conditions. For that reason, <a href=\"https://www.srpco.com/gaskets/3m-adhesive-tapes/\">3M acrylic foam tape</a> is ideal for automotive applications.</p>\n<h4>Using custom cut 3M automotive foam tape in place of mechanical fasteners:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Results in a lighter, more streamlined component</li>\n<li>Enhances the look of your product</li>\n<li>Maintains the integrity of the seal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not only that, but using 3M automotive foam tape in your custom converted product will also result in meaningful savings in time and labor.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Mechanical benefits of Acrylic Foam Tapes by 3M</h2>\n<p>3M foam tapes are made with a <strong>viscoelastic formula</strong> that allows the adhesive to flow into the surface while <strong>building strength</strong>, lending it <strong>robust shear and peel strength properties</strong> with a <strong>long-lasting performance</strong> that automotive components demand.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The foam core of 3M acrylic foam tape has <strong>unique stress-relaxation properties</strong>, allowing it to <strong>expand and contract</strong> with temperature changes.</li>\n<li>Adhesive is <strong>engineered for elongation and stress relaxation</strong>.</li>\n<li>Foam core is designed to <strong>dissipate stress forces</strong> when exposed to high stress load.</li>\n<li>Flexible foam core of <a href=\"https://www.srpco.com/gaskets/3m-foam-tapes/\">double-stick acrylic foam tape</a> allows tape to <strong>conform</strong> to <strong>irregular surfaces and gaps</strong>.</li>\n<li>Acrylic adhesive <strong>resists exposure to temperature fluctuations, weather conditions, UV rays</strong> and <strong>solvents</strong> during the life of the product, making it well suited to automotive applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Assembly benefits of automotive acrylic foam tape</h2>\n<h4>Replacing rivets and other mechanical fasteners on automotive components with acrylic foam tape can <strong>improve uptime and throughput</strong> in the assembly process:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.srpco.com/gaskets/3m-acrylic-foam-tapes/\">Acrylic foam tape</a> can be <strong>die-cut into intricate shapes</strong>, and <strong>attached to elastomeric materials</strong> for easy peel-and-stick attachment when assembling automotive components.</li>\n<li>Lack of drilling and riveting <strong>reduces the need for training and labor</strong>, along with the risk of injury.</li>\n<li>Assembly of acrylic foam tape can be <strong>completed manually or with automation</strong>.</li>\n<li>Tapes require <strong>no drying and curing</strong>, and reach handling strength shortly after application.</li>\n<li>Streamlining of processes and materials results in <strong>less labor and costs</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Aesthetic benefits of 3M Acrylic Foam Tape</h2>\n<h4>Automotive foam tape streamlines and improves the appearance and function of the design.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Eliminates</strong> the need to use unsightly <strong>bolts, rivets and screws</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Smoother</strong> surface creates attractive, aerodynamic design.</li>\n<li>Elimination of mechanical fasteners greatly <strong>reduces opportunities to develop rust when exposed to rain and other weather events</strong>.</li>\n<li>Reduces the need to drill into automotive painted surfaces.</li>\n<li>Ability to <strong>absorb sound and vibration</strong> reduces rattling and muffles sounds, creating a more pleasant experience for the end-user.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>The 3M advantage</h2>\n<p>Using 3M Acrylic Foam Tape for your <a href=\"https://www.srpco.com/custom-3m-adhesive-tape-and-its-benefits/\">automotive custom
