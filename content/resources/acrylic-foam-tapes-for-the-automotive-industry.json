NO WELDS. NO RIVETS.We are living in a time when automobiles are constantly changing. Not just the design, but the way they are manufactured. The system in which automobiles are being produced is also evolving.With technology evolving at a rapid rate, manufacturing and assembly of automobiles is becoming more and more efficient every year. Whether it’s automation or manual assembly, companies are looking for the next method to increase speed and reduce expenses without sacrificing safety.It has long been known that the use of fasteners, welds and rivets is becoming obsolete for interior and exterior applications in automotive and recreational vehicles. They simply do not provide the performance, aesthetics or ease of installation compared to the competition.AUTOMOTIVE FOAM TAPE: YOUR BEST BETEnter foam tapes as your solution to rivets, screws and welds. Foam tapes are not a new technology. In fact, they have been around for decades. What is new, however, are emerging applications for foam tapes. As foam tapes evolve, they find their way into new industries for different uses, including sealing gaskets for electronics, attaching glass panels to skyscrapers, and bonding nameplates and logos to various substrates.Because acrylic foam tape eliminates the need for fasteners, welds and rivets, it can transform the performance, efficiency and price for a variety of applications.Benefits of automotive foam tapes by 3MAcrylic foam tape from 3M is more than just a tape. Decades of sophisticated engineering have resulted in a standard-bearing bonding system designed to create a strong, enduring bond that resists degradation from environmental conditions. For that reason, 3M acrylic foam tape is ideal for automotive applications.Using custom cut 3M automotive foam tape in place of mechanical fasteners:Results in a lighter, more streamlined componentEnhances the look of your productMaintains the integrity of the seal.Not only that, but using 3M automotive foam tape in your custom converted product will also result in meaningful savings in time and labor.Mechanical benefits of Acrylic Foam Tapes by 3M3M foam tapes are made with a viscoelastic formula that allows the adhesive to flow into the surface while building strength, lending it robust shear and peel strength properties with a long-lasting performance that automotive components demand.The foam core of 3M acrylic foam tape has unique stress-relaxation properties, allowing it to expand and contract with temperature changes.Adhesive is engineered for elongation and stress relaxation.Foam core is designed to dissipate stress forces when exposed to high stress load.Flexible foam core of double-stick acrylic foam tape allows tape to conform to irregular surfaces and gaps.Acrylic adhesive resists exposure to temperature fluctuations, weather conditions, UV rays and solvents during the life of the product, making it well suited to automotive applications.Assembly benefits of automotive acrylic foam tapeReplacing rivets and other mechanical fasteners on automotive components with acrylic foam tape can improve uptime and throughput in the assembly process:Acrylic foam tape can be die-cut into intricate shapes, and attached to elastomeric materials for easy peel-and-stick attachment when assembling automotive components.Lack of drilling and riveting reduces the need for training and labor, along with the risk of injury.Assembly of acrylic foam tape can be completed manually or with automation.Tapes require no drying and curing, and reach handling strength shortly after application.Streamlining of processes and materials results in less labor and costs.Aesthetic benefits of 3M Acrylic Foam TapeAutomotive foam tape streamlines and improves the appearance and function of the design.Eliminates the need to use unsightly bolts, rivets and screws.Smoother surface creates attractive, aerodynamic design.Elimination of mechanical fasteners greatly reduces opportunities to develop rust when exposed to rain and other weather events.Reduces the need to drill into automotive painted surfaces.Ability to absorb sound and vibration reduces rattling and muffles sounds, creating a more pleasant experience for the end-user.The 3M advantageUsing 3M Acrylic Foam Tape for your automotive custom converter product has several important advantages.Backed by a full range of support services for automotive applications.Assurance that performance of the adhesive meets the product and design engineering requirements of the automotive application.Has satisfied the requirements of specific automotive model program requirements since 1978.Read more about the benefits of using a 3M bonding system in your custom converter product.Top applications of 3M Acrylic Foam TapeThe following are typical automotive applications of 3M Acrylic Foam Tape:Attachment of trim partsBonding seals throughout the car bodyDoor and window sealsDoor cladding and inlayRoof railsSpoilerRocker panel / body side moldingParking sensor retainersACRYLIC FOAM TAPES FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY3M Acrylic Plus Tape Series PT1000This black, double-coated acrylic foam is designed to attach automotive exterior trim parts, including claddings and body side moldings.3M Tape Series PT1000 offers the following key features:High conformabilityBlack, high-strength core with low elongation propertiesCold temperature impact resistanceEasy liner release3M Acrylic Foam Tape GT71083M Acrylic Foam Tape GT7108 is suited for attaching emblems, nameplates, moldings, step pads and other automotive trim.
