The show will take place from March 6th – 8th at the Suburban Collection Showplace. This is our first trade show of the year, and we are very much looking forward to exhibiting!For those who don’t know, the Foam Expo is North America’s first free-to-attend exhibition and conference for the technical foam industry. The exhibition will unite manufacturers and buyers of technical foam materials, products and services and will serve the entire foam manufacturing industry. This includes raw materials, chemicals, manufacture and process equipment and all associated services including custom fabrication and die-cutting.Most of what we convert here at SRP deals with various types of foams in varying densities, thicknesses, and specifications. We work with them all and we can provide custom lamination and die-cutting services for customers in need of foam fabricated parts and components such as gaskets, cushions, and seals for a variety of applications. The Foam Expo allows us to show individuals all the capabilities we have to offer, and why they are a major competitive advantage when it comes to efficiency and cost-effectiveness.One of the finest aspects of this show is that a lot of our major suppliers are in attendance and exhibiting. This gives us the perfect opportunity to get in front of all of them and see what they are rolling out or will be developing in the near future. Not only that, it’s also a really great way to catch up with a lot of familiar faces, and also meet some new ones!If you are planning to attend the show, SRP will be in booth #321. Don’t be shy, just drop on by.
