{"title":"Identifying the Proper Electrical Enclosure Gasket","slug":"identifying-proper-electrical-enclosure-gasket-2","type":"resource","collectionType":"resources","content":"<p>The function of an electrical enclosure gasket is to not only protect electronic components contained in electrical housings from outside elements such as weather, but also to prevent electrical hazards from escaping the unit. The proper gasket will provide a tight seal in both indoor and outdoor enclosure applications, with the ability to withstand the life of the product.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ensuring the Proper Performance of an Electrical Enclosure Gasket</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the most important aspects of an electrical enclosure gasket is ensuring the gasket passes specific application requirements. Most electrical enclosure applications need to comply with certain types and ratings such as NEMA, UL, and IP (Ingress Protection).</p>\n<p><strong>To pass such inspections, you need to consider the following questions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Temperature – What temperature range will be required?</li>\n<li>Location – Will the application be indoor or outdoor?</li>\n<li>UV Resistance – Will the material be directly exposed?</li>\n<li>Flame Resistance – Will the material require a certain flame rating?</li>\n<li>Outgassing – Will material outgassing harm electrical components?</li>\n<li>Gap Spacing – What is the area needed to be filled by the gasket?</li>\n<li>Gasket Function – What protection will the gasket need to provide? (air, liquid, vibration?)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>Material Selection for Custom Electrical Enclosure Gaskets</strong></h3>\n<p>If you are able to provide answers to the above questions, the material selection process will streamline. There are a variety of materials to choose from when it comes to providing the perfect seal in enclosures. Specifically speaking to gasket performance, it’s easy for suppliers to recommend a material that over performs the requirements, resulting in higher spending. It is important to find the most cost-effective solution for each application, while delivering optimum performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Common materials used for custom electrical enclosure gaskets include the following:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.srpco.com/materials/sponge/\">Closed Cell Sponge Rubber</a> (Neoprene, EPDM, Nitrile, PVC, SBR)</li>\n<li>Cellular Urethane</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.srpco.com/cross-linked-polyethylene-xlpe/\">Polyethylene</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.srpco.com/materials/rogers-poron/\">PORON® Polyurethane</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.srpco.com/materials/rogers-bisco/\">BISCO® Silicone</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All materials can be supplied adhesive backed with a pressure sensitive adhesive if required.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>What Are the Risks Associated with An Underperforming Seal?</strong><strong> </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cost of replacement gaskets and the maintenance associated with replacement</li>\n<li>Possible loss of UL enclosure rating</li>\n<li>Cost of damaged electronic components in an enclosure</li>\n<li>Systematic errors caused by damaged electrical components</li>\n<li>Quality concerns from enclosure manufacturers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SRP has been supplying custom electrical enclosure gaskets to the industrial, electronic, HVAC, and telecommunications industries for many years.
