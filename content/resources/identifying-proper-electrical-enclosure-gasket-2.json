The proper gasket will provide a tight seal in both indoor and outdoor enclosure applications, with the ability to withstand the life of the product.Ensuring the Proper Performance of an Electrical Enclosure GasketOne of the most important aspects of an electrical enclosure gasket is ensuring the gasket passes specific application requirements. Most electrical enclosure applications need to comply with certain types and ratings such as NEMA, UL, and IP (Ingress Protection).To pass such inspections, you need to consider the following questions:Temperature – What temperature range will be required?Location – Will the application be indoor or outdoor?UV Resistance – Will the material be directly exposed?Flame Resistance – Will the material require a certain flame rating?Outgassing – Will material outgassing harm electrical components?Gap Spacing – What is the area needed to be filled by the gasket?Gasket Function – What protection will the gasket need to provide? (air, liquid, vibration?)Material Selection for Custom Electrical Enclosure GasketsIf you are able to provide answers to the above questions, the material selection process will streamline. There are a variety of materials to choose from when it comes to providing the perfect seal in enclosures. Specifically speaking to gasket performance, it’s easy for suppliers to recommend a material that over performs the requirements, resulting in higher spending. It is important to find the most cost-effective solution for each application, while delivering optimum performance.Common materials used for custom electrical enclosure gaskets include the following:Closed Cell Sponge Rubber (Neoprene, EPDM, Nitrile, PVC, SBR)Cellular UrethanePolyethylenePORON® PolyurethaneBISCO® SiliconeAll materials can be supplied adhesive backed with a pressure sensitive adhesive if required.What Are the Risks Associated with An Underperforming Seal? Cost of replacement gaskets and the maintenance associated with replacementPossible loss of UL enclosure ratingCost of damaged electronic components in an enclosureSystematic errors caused by damaged electrical componentsQuality concerns from enclosure manufacturersSRP has been supplying custom electrical enclosure gaskets to the industrial, electronic, HVAC, and telecommunications industries for many years.
