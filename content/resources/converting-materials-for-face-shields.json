It is important to note that the material should be thick enough to allow enough space for users to wear safety glasses and a face mask for optimum protection (.750” – 1.00”). We also recommend a product with a smooth surface for comfortability. All cushion materials can be supplied with a pressure sensitive adhesive backing for easy application to the PET.</p>\n<h6><strong>Below is a list of materials that we recommend using for shield cushions:</strong></h6>\n<ul>\n<li>PORON Polyurethane Foam</li>\n<li>Armaflex AP Foam (Anti-Microbial)</li>\n<li>Gaska Tape V710 PVC Foam</li>\n<li>Gaska Tape V810 PVC Foam</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SRP has long-standing relationships with the suppliers of these materials. Depending on their availability, we can acquire these materials and convert them in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p>Although we are going through difficult times, it is positive to see manufactures and suppliers band together to assist in helping those that need it most.</p>\n","order":0,"description":null,"youtube":null,"resourceType":"article","createdAt":"2022-04-15T19:58:04.802Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-24T12:04:15.825Z","publishedAt":"2020-04-30T07:17:53.000Z","media":{},"seo":{"id":350,"title":"Converting Materials for Face Shields","description":null,"image":{}},"blocks":[],"pageSettings":null,"id":14}
