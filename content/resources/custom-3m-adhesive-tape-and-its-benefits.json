These 3M products are also designed to take care of many of your assembly problems with simple, yet very effective solutions. These adhesives have the ability to replace welds, screws and rivets that create a lighter, higher performing, and more cost effective end component.</p>\n<h3>Double-Sided Tape</h3>\n<p>Did you know that 3M makes many different types of double-sided tapes for a wide range of applications? 3M double-sided tapes can be applied with automated machinery or manually. They are made to stay in place, form a permanent bond, and they create a seamless bond without any lines. No matter what size or shape you need, SRP can accommodate your custom 3M adhesive tape requirements.</p>\n<h3>Adhesive Transfer Tape</h3>\n<p>Maybe you need to bond or join thin materials. Standard tape products simply won’t do the job, but 3M adhesive transfer tapes may be just what you need. They are thin enough so you don’t have any problems with bunching or wrinkles. Transfer tape is different from standard double-sided tape. 3M™ Double Sided Tapes feature an internal carrier, such as polyester film, tissue or paper. Transfer tapes have adhesive on the release layer.</p>\n<h3>Foam Tape</h3>\n<p>SRP can fabricate both single and double-sided foam tapes. Single-sided foam is good for sealing out dust, contaminants, moisture, and vibrations. Double-sided foam is perfect for bonding dissimilar materials like concrete, glass, plastic, steel, or wood. It’s one of the quickest and most effective bonding methods.</p>\n<h3>Specialty Custom 3M Adhesive Tape Products</h3>\n<p>SRP’s capabilities allow us to fabricate a wide range of materials for applications including EMI shielding, thermal management, weather sealing, and surface protection for a variety of substrates. These are just a few of the many things we can do for your business.
