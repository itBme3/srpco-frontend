Many of the materials used to manufacture custom gaskets need to be Mil-Spec certified in order to be used in the industry. Mil-Spec is a strict set of standards used to achieve standardization objectives by the U.S. Department of Defense. Standardization is beneficial in ensuring products meet certain requirements, commonality, reliability, and compatibility.Below is a list of materials used in the defense industry that SRP commonly converts right here in the United States.Mil-Spec Sheet RubberSheet rubber can come in a variety of formulations. Most manufacturers of sheet rubber have a line of Mil-Spec certified rubber for military-grade products made to meet and exceed military specifications. Military-grade sheet rubber can be provided in Neoprene, Nitrile, Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR) and EPDM. These formulations are available in a variety of durometers, tensile strengths and temperature ranges. From applications requiring resistance to oil and solvents, abrasion and flex cracking, ozone and sunlight, heat, water, and steam, to products that require excellent tear strength, vibration damping, temperature specifications, and compression set.Viton® is also available as a Mil-Spec certified grade and offers higher performance than other sheet rubber formulations. Viton® has a broad range of resistance to oils, fuels, lubricants and most mineral acids. It offers very good resistance to many aliphatic hydrocarbon fluids that act as solvents for many other rubbers. It also provides exceptionally good compression set resistance; even at temperatures that can degrade other non-fluorinated elastomers. Viton® has good resistance to atmospheric oxidation, sun, and weather, and excellent resistance to fungus and mold.Polyurethane FoamPORON® offers excellent compression set resistance, which enables durable, long-term sealing performance. Other benefits include low-outgassing and non-fogging, which means the material contains no plasticizers or residual chemicals. The material will not become brittle and crumble and is non-corrosive to metal. PORON® has good chemical resistance, is easy to fabricate, die-cuts cleanly, and works with a broad range of adhesives.Silicone  Silicone materials are known for their performance in high temperature conditions. Silicone is commonly converted into products such as heat shields, gaskets, fire stops, seals, cushions, and insulation for a wide variety of applications including military and defense. Silicone materials are resistant to temperature extremes, UV &amp; ozone, resilient to mechanical fatigue, offer excellent compression set resistance, and meet the most stringent UL flame ratings.Silicone materials are available in both cellular foam, sponge, and solid rubber formulations. The silicone best suited for the defense industry include Saint Gobain NORSEAL® (formerly COHRlastic®), and BISCO® from Rogers Corporation, and are all available with Pressure Sensitive Adhesives.PTFETeflon® PTFE gaskets are used in many industrial applications. They have high performance capabilities including high temperature resistance, surface-wear resistance and resistance to corrosive fluids and is naturally hydrophobic. PTFE has excellent dielectric and thermal insulation properties, with an operating temperature range of -400°F to 500°F. Teflon® PTFE can be fabricated into custom gaskets for defense applications that require the gasket to withstand the life of the product.EMI/RFIElectrical Insulation materials are essential in military components where electricity is present. These materials offer excellent ignitability resistance, arc and track resistance, and good dielectric strength. They can help provide protection to the products and the people using and working with them by providing a barrier to keep electricity contained within the product.Some common insulator materials include: conductive silicones, Kapton® polyimide films, Nomex® Aramid Fibre, Formex®, 3M™ FRB®, Mylar® polyester films, and Lexan® polycarbonates.About SRPSRP has the capabilities to custom fabricate a variety of gaskets and seals for the military and defense industry.
