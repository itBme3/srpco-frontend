In a world where it seems that trade shows appear to be a fading event for the converting industry, this year the D2P show proved otherwise. Maybe it was the fact that companies were laying low in 2015 as the economy continued to slowly dwindle for the industry, even into the early months of this year. However, it looks as though things are starting to pick back up, at least for SRP.<br />\n<img src=\"http://localhost:1337/uploads/image_0_0_0b4b0cc9d7.jpeg\" style=\"height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 350px\" /><br />\nThis was by far the most successful show we have attended for our company in years. Of course, the final results cannot be gauged until a few months down the road, so we</p>\n<p>don’t want to get too far ahead of ourselves. Talking to many of the other companies exhibiting, it seemed the show was a success for them as well. Whether or not the show was a success for all exhibitors, the interest level of the people attending the show makes it look like things are headed in a positive direction.</p>\n<p>We spoke with a lot of entrepreneurial start ups looking for prototyping services. The amount of people that are in the design phase of their new projects is very exciting, and isalso another indicator that manufacturing in the converting industry should be back on the up and up soon, so we hope. We would like to thank the D2P team for a successful show on their end, and we look forward to D2P 2017.  We also want to thank Gramovox for supplying their floating record player and Gramaphone Bluetooth speaker for our display. It brought a lot of buzz to booth #349!</p>\n<p>It is incredible to think how quickly we are approaching the midway point of the year. What is even more incredible is that we are still dealing with mild winter weather in Elk Grove. Our plans as far as trade shows and events go for the rest of the year include the Rwilo Events that aim to elevate art, design, and manufacturing innovation communities. People and businesses collaborate to share ideas, find opportunities, and build solutions. SRP is proud to be a co-sponsor for the event series.
