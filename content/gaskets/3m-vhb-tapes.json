Polycarbonate, Aluminum, Galvanized Steel 90C   Unplasticized PVC 75C Our testing has shown that 3M Adhesive 100MP yielded 92 retention of peel adhesion after the roll was aged for more than 5 years at an elevated temperature of   150F 65C The initial tack and liner release properties were still excellent This testing result suggests that the tape is relatively unaected by longterm exposure to   elevated temperatures Bonds made with 3M Adhesive 100MP can tolerate periodic shortterm exposures to temperatures up to 500F 260C   3M Adhesive 100MP is thermoplastic in nature, becoming softer as temperature increases and rmer as temperature decreases As the adhesive becomes rmer, the   performance generally increases This performance increase is demonstrated graphically in Figure 1 for 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9473PC It shows the   breakaway and peel forces as a function of temperature The exception of the performance increase is at very low temperatures when high impact stresses along with   high frequencies are encountered At low temperatures, the tape becomes very rm and glassy the ability to absorb impact energy is reduced Dynamic Mechanical Properties For engineers who have to use adhesive properties for modeling and analysis purpose, we suggest a Youngs modulus of 45  102 kPA measured at 23C  1 Hz and   a Poissons ratio of 0499 For detailed adhesive modulus and damping properties, please refer to the nomograph for 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tapes, which is   available upon request through our technical service group The nomograph presents adhesive modulus and

Adhesives must ow onto the substrate surfaces in order to achieve intimate contact area and   allow the molecular force of attraction to develop The degree of ow of the adhesive on the substrate is largely determined by the surface energy of the substrate   3M VHB 4941 family tapes bond well to high HSE and medium MSE surface energy materials  The image below shows typical materials in these categories   Achieving good contact is also important  The necessary thickness of tape depends on the rigidity of substrates and their atness irregularity While the 3M VHB   Tapes will conform to a certain amount of irregularity, they will not ow to ll gaps between the materials For bonding rigid materials with normal atness, consider   use of tapes with thickness of 45 mils 11 mm or greater As the substrate exibility increases thinner tapes can be considered   Using the right amount of tape is important to handle the expected stresses  Because 3M VHB Tapes are viscoelastic by nature their strength and stiness is a   function of the rate at which they are stressed They behave stronger with relatively faster rate of stress load dynamic stresses and will tend to show creep behavior   with stress load acting over a long period of time static stresses As a general rule, for static loads, approximately four square inches of tape should be used for each   pound 57 cm of tape per kg of weight to be supported in order to prevent excessive creep For dynamic loads a useful design factor is 12 lbin2 85 kPa for most   dynamic stresses in general applications    Allow for thermal expansioncontraction  3M VHB Tapes can perform well in applications where two bonded surfaces may expand and contract dierentially   Assuming good adhesion to the substrates, the tapes can typically tolerate dierential movement in the shear plane up to 3 times their thickness   Bond Flexibility While an advantage for many applications where allowing dierential movement is a benet, the tape bonds are typically more exible than alternative   bonding methods Suitable design modications or periodic use of rigid fasteners or adhesives may be needed if additional stiness is required   Performance in Severe Cold Temperature can be challenging Applications which require performance at severe cold temperatures must be thoroughly evaluated by   the user if the intended use will subject the tape product to high impact stresses A technical bulletin 3M VHB Tape Cold Temperature Performance 700707 39910 is available for additional information 3M VHB Tape 4941 Design Considerations continued 3M VHB Tape 4941 HandlingApplication Information Application Techniques Clean Most substrates are best prepared by cleaning with a 5050 mixture of isopropyl alcohol IPA and water prior to applying 3M VHB Tapes   Exceptions to the general procedure that may require additional surface preparation include    Heavy Oils A degreaser or solventbased cleaner may be required to remove heavy oil or grease from a surface and should be followed by cleaning with IPAwater    Abrasion Abrading a surface, followed by cleaning with IPAwater, can remove heavy dirt or oxidation and can increase surface area to improve adhesion    Adhesion Promoters Priming a surface can signicantly improve initial and ultimate adhesion to many materials such as plastics and paints    Porous surfaces Most porous and bered materials such as wood, particleboard, concrete, etc need to be sealed to provide a unied surface    Unique Materials Special surface preparation may be needed for glass and glasslike materials, copper and copper containing metals, and plastics or rubber that   contain components that migrate eg plasticizers   Refer to 3M Technical Bulletin Surface Preparation for 3M VHB Tape Applications for

the   cleaner is compliant When using solvents, be sure to follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when handling such materials   Pressure Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure develops better adhesive contact and   helps improve bond strength Typically, good surface contact can be attained by applying enough pressure to insure that the tape experiences approximately 15 psi   100 kPa pressure Either roller or platen pressure can be used Note that rigid surfaces may require 2 or 3 times that much pressure to make the tape experience 15   psi   Temperature Ideal application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Pressure sensitive adhesives use viscous ow to achieve substrate contact area   Minimum suggested application temperature for the 3M VHB Tape 4941 family is 60F 15C  Minimum application temperature does vary by 3M VHB tape   family and ranges from  32F to 60F 0C to 15C   Note Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below these suggested minimums is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere   readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory To obtain good performance with all 3M VHB Tapes, it is important to   ensure that the surfaces are dry and free of condensed moisture   Time After application, the bond strength will increase as the adhesive ows onto the surface also referred to as wet out At room temperature approximately 50   of ultimate bond strength will be achieved after 20 minutes, 90 after 24 hours and 100 after 72 hours This ow is faster at higher temperatures and slower at lower   temperatures Ultimate bond strength can be achieved more quickly and in some cases bond strength can be increased by exposure of the bond to elevated   temperatures eg 150F 66C for 1 hour This can provide better adhesive wetout onto the substrates Abrasion of the surfaces or the use of primers adhesion   promoters can also have the eect of increasing bond strength and achieving ultimate bond strength more quickly Converting In addition to standard and custom roll sizes available

bonding success  Adhesives must ow onto the substrate surfaces in order to achieve intimate contact area and   allow the molecular force of attraction to develop The degree of ow of the adhesive on the substrate is largely determined by the surface energy of the substrate   3M VHB 5952 family tapes bond well to high HSE, medium MSE, and mediumlow MLSE surface energy materials  The image below shows typical materials   in these categories   Achieving good contact is also important  The necessary thickness of tape depends on the rigidity of substrates and their atness irregularity While the 3M VHB   Tapes will conform to a certain amount of irregularity, they will not ow to ll gaps between the materials For bonding rigid materials with normal atness, consider   use of tapes with thickness of 45 mils 11 mm or greater As the substrate exibility increases thinner tapes can be considered   Using the right amount of tape is important to handle the expected stresses  Because 3M VHB Tapes are viscoelastic by nature their strength and stiness is a   function of the rate at which they are stressed They behave stronger with relatively faster rate of stress load dynamic stresses and will tend to show creep behavior   with stress load acting over a long period of time static stresses As a general rule, for static loads, approximately four square inches of tape should be used for each   pound 57 cm of tape per kg of weight to be supported in order to prevent excessive creep For dynamic loads a useful design factor is 12 lbin2 85 kPa for most   dynamic stresses in general applications    Allow for thermal expansioncontraction  3M VHB Tapes can perform well in applications where two bonded surfaces may expand and contract dierentially   Assuming good adhesion to the substrates, the tapes can typically tolerate dierential movement in the shear plane up to 3 times their thickness   Bond Flexibility While an advantage for many applications where allowing dierential movement is a benet, the tape bonds are typically more exible than alternative   bonding methods Suitable design modications or periodic use of rigid fasteners or adhesives may be needed if additional stiness is required   Performance in Severe Cold Temperature can be challenging Applications which require performance at severe cold temperatures must be thoroughly evaluated by   the user if the intended use will subject the tape product to high impact stresses A technical bulletin 3M VHB Tape Cold Temperature Performance 700707 39910 is available for additional information 3M VHB Tape 5952

Considerations Adhesion to the substrate is important in achieving bonding success  Adhesives must ow onto the substrate surfaces in order to achieve intimate contact area and   allow the molecular force of attraction to develop The degree of ow of the adhesive on the substrate is largely determined by the surface energy of the substrate   3M VHB RP family tapes bond well to high HSE and medium MSE surface energy materials  The image below shows typical materials in these categories   Achieving good contact is also important  The necessary thickness of tape depends on the rigidity of substrates and their atness irregularity While the 3M VHB   Tapes will conform to a certain amount of irregularity, they will not ow to ll gaps between the materials For bonding rigid materials with normal atness, consider   use of tapes with thickness of 45 mils 11 mm or greater As the substrate exibility increases thinner tapes can be considered   Using the right amount of tape is important to handle the expected stresses  Because 3M VHB Tapes are viscoelastic by nature their strength and stiness is a   function of the rate at which they are stressed They behave stronger with relatively faster rate of stress load dynamic stresses and will tend to show creep behavior   with stress load acting over a long period of time static stresses As a general rule, for static loads, approximately four square inches of tape should be used for each   pound 57 cm of tape per kg of weight to be supported in order to prevent excessive creep For dynamic loads a useful design factor is 12 lbin2 85 kPa for most   dynamic stresses in general applications    Allow for thermal expansioncontraction  3M VHB Tapes can perform well in applications where two bonded surfaces may expand and contract dierentially   Assuming good adhesion to the substrates, the tapes can typically tolerate dierential movement in the shear plane up to 3 times their thickness   Bond Flexibility While an advantage for many applications where allowing dierential movement is a benet, the tape bonds are typically more exible than alternative   bonding methods Suitable design modications or periodic use of rigid fasteners or adhesives may be needed if additional stiness is required   Performance in Severe Cold Temperature can be challenging Applications which require performance at severe cold temperatures must be thoroughly evaluated by   the user if the intended use will subject the tape product to high impact stresses A technical bulletin 3M VHB Tape Cold Temperature Performance 700707 39910 is available for additional information 3M VHB Tape RP16 Design Considerations continued 3M VHB Tape RP16 HandlingApplication Information Application Techniques Clean Most substrates are best prepared by cleaning with a 5050 mixture of isopropyl alcohol IPA and water prior to applying 3M VHB Tapes   Exceptions to the general procedure that may require additional surface preparation include    Heavy Oils A degreaser or solventbased cleaner may be required to remove heavy oil or grease from a surface and should be followed by cleaning with IPAwater    Abrasion Abrading a surface, followed by cleaning with IPAwater, can remove heavy dirt or oxidation and can increase surface area to improve adhesion    Adhesion Promoters Priming a surface can signicantly improve initial and ultimate adhesion to many materials such as plastics and paints    Porous surfaces Most porous and bered materials such as wood, particleboard, concrete, etc need to be sealed to provide a unied surface    Unique Materials Special surface preparation may be needed for glass and glasslike materials, copper and copper containing metals, and plastics or rubber that   contain components that migrate eg plasticizers   Refer to 3M Technical Bulletin Surface Preparation for 3M VHB Tape Applications for additional details and suggestions 70070487015   Note These cleaner solutions contain greater than 250 gl of volatile organic compounds VOC Please consult your local Air Quality Regulations to be sure the   cleaner is compliant When using solvents, be sure to follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when handling such materials   Pressure Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure develops better adhesive contact and   helps improve bond strength Typically, good surface contact can be attained by applying enough pressure to insure that the tape experiences approximately 15 psi   100 kPa pressure Either roller or platen pressure can be used Note that rigid surfaces may require 2 or 3 times that much pressure to make the tape experience 15   psi   Temperature Ideal application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Pressure sensitive adhesives use viscous ow to achieve substrate contact area   Minimum suggested application temperature for the 3M VHB Tape RP family is 50F 10C  Minimum application temperature does vary by 3M VHB tape   family and ranges from  32F to 60F 0C to 15C   Note Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below these suggested minimums is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere   readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory To obtain good performance with all 3M VHB Tapes, it is important to   ensure that the surfaces are dry and free of condensed moisture   Time After application, the bond strength will increase as the adhesive ows onto the surface also referred to as wet out At room temperature approximately 50   of ultimate bond strength will be achieved after 20 minutes, 90 after 24 hours and 100 after 72 hours This ow is faster at higher temperatures and slower at lower   temperatures Ultimate bond strength can be achieved more quickly and in some cases bond strength can be increased by exposure of the bond to elevated   temperatures eg 150F 66C for 1 hour This can provide better adhesive wetout onto the substrates Abrasion of the surfaces or the use of primers adhesion   promoters can also have the eect of increasing bond strength and achieving ultimate bond strength more quickly Converting In addition to standard and custom roll sizes available from 3M through the distribution network, 3M VHB Tapes are also available in limitless shapes and

and Shelf Life All 3M VHB Tapes have a shelf life of 24 months from date of manufacture when stored at 40F to 100F 4C to 38C and 095 relative humidity The optimum   storage conditions are 72F 22C and 50 relative humidity   Performance of tapes is not projected to change even after shelf life expires however, 3M does suggest that 3M VHB Tapes are used prior to the shelf life date   whenever possible   The manufacturing date is available on all 3M VHB Tapes as the lot number, typically marked on the core or on a label on the outer roll lap The lot number,   typically a 4 digit code, is a

Considerations Adhesion to the substrate is important in achieving bonding success  Adhesives must ow onto the substrate surfaces in order to achieve intimate contact area and   allow the molecular force of attraction to develop The degree of ow of the adhesive on the substrate is largely determined by the surface energy of the substrate   3M VHB RP family tapes bond well to high HSE and medium MSE surface energy materials  The image below shows typical materials in these categories   Achieving good contact is also important  The necessary thickness of tape depends on the rigidity of substrates and their atness irregularity While the 3M VHB   Tapes will conform to a certain amount of irregularity, they will not ow to ll gaps between the materials For bonding rigid materials with normal atness, consider   use of tapes with thickness of 45 mils 11 mm or greater As the substrate exibility increases thinner tapes can be considered   Using the right amount of tape is important to handle the expected stresses  Because 3M VHB Tapes are viscoelastic by nature their strength and stiness is a   function of the rate at which they are stressed They behave stronger with relatively faster rate of stress load dynamic stresses and will tend to show creep behavior   with stress load acting over a long period of time static stresses As a general rule, for static loads, approximately four square inches of tape should be used for each   pound 57 cm of tape per kg of weight to be supported in order to prevent excessive creep For dynamic loads a useful design factor is 12 lbin2 85 kPa for most   dynamic stresses in general applications    Allow for thermal expansioncontraction  3M VHB Tapes can perform well in applications where two bonded surfaces may expand and contract dierentially   Assuming good adhesion to the substrates, the tapes can typically tolerate dierential movement in the shear plane up to 3 times their thickness   Bond Flexibility While an advantage for many applications where allowing dierential movement is a benet, the tape bonds are typically more exible than alternative   bonding methods Suitable design modications or periodic use of rigid fasteners or adhesives may be needed if additional stiness is required   Performance in Severe Cold Temperature can be challenging Applications which require performance at severe cold temperatures must be thoroughly evaluated by   the user if the intended use will subject the tape product to high impact stresses A technical bulletin 3M VHB Tape Cold Temperature Performance 700707 39910 is available for additional information 3M VHB Tape RP45 Design Considerations continued 3M VHB Tape RP45 HandlingApplication Information Application Techniques Clean Most substrates are best prepared by cleaning with a 5050 mixture of isopropyl alcohol IPA and water prior to applying 3M VHB Tapes   Exceptions to the general procedure that may require additional surface preparation include    Heavy Oils A degreaser or solventbased cleaner may be required to remove heavy oil or grease from a surface and should be followed by cleaning with IPAwater    Abrasion Abrading a surface, followed by cleaning with IPAwater, can remove heavy dirt or oxidation and can increase surface area to improve adhesion    Adhesion Promoters Priming a surface can signicantly improve initial and ultimate adhesion to many materials such as plastics and paints    Porous surfaces Most porous and bered materials such as wood, particleboard, concrete, etc need to be sealed to provide a unied surface    Unique Materials Special surface preparation may be needed for glass and glasslike materials, copper and copper containing metals, and plastics or rubber that   contain components that migrate eg plasticizers   Refer to 3M Technical Bulletin Surface Preparation for 3M VHB Tape Applications for additional details and suggestions 70070487015   Note These cleaner solutions contain greater than 250 gl of volatile organic compounds VOC Please consult your local Air Quality Regulations to be sure the   cleaner is compliant When using solvents, be sure to follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when handling such materials   Pressure Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure develops better adhesive contact and   helps improve bond strength Typically, good surface contact can be attained by applying enough pressure to insure that the tape experiences approximately 15 psi   100 kPa pressure Either roller or platen pressure can be used Note that rigid surfaces may require 2 or 3 times that much pressure to make the tape experience 15   psi   Temperature Ideal application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Pressure sensitive adhesives use viscous ow to achieve substrate contact area   Minimum suggested application temperature for the 3M VHB Tape RP family is 50F 10C  Minimum application temperature does vary by 3M VHB tape   family and ranges from  32F to 60F 0C to 15C   Note Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below these suggested minimums is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere   readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory To obtain good performance with all 3M VHB Tapes, it is important to   ensure that the surfaces are dry and free of condensed moisture   Time After application, the bond strength will increase as the adhesive ows onto the surface also referred to as wet out At room temperature approximately 50   of ultimate bond strength will be achieved after 20 minutes, 90 after 24 hours and 100 after 72 hours This ow is faster at higher temperatures and slower at lower   temperatures Ultimate bond strength can be achieved more quickly and in some cases bond strength can be increased by exposure of the bond to elevated   temperatures eg 150F 66C for 1 hour This can provide better adhesive wetout onto the substrates Abrasion of the surfaces or the use of primers adhesion   promoters can also have the eect of increasing bond strength and achieving ultimate bond strength more quickly Converting In addition to standard and custom roll sizes available from 3M through the distribution network, 3M VHB Tapes are also available in limitless shapes and

and Shelf Life All 3M VHB Tapes have a shelf life of 24 months from date of manufacture when stored at 40F to 100F 4C to 38C and 095 relative humidity The optimum   storage conditions are 72F 22C and 50 relative humidity   Performance of tapes is not projected to change even after shelf life expires however, 3M does suggest that 3M VHB Tapes are used prior to the shelf life date   whenever possible   The manufacturing date is available on all 3M VHB Tapes as the lot number, typically marked on the core or on a label on the outer roll lap The lot number,   typically a 4 digit code, is a Julian date Y D D D The rst digit refers to the year of manufacture, the last 3 digits refer to the days after January 1 Example A lot   number of 7266 or 17266 would translate to a date of
