the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100F 38C to 130F 54C, will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unified Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane  Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too firm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory  When using solvents, extinguish all ignition sources, including pilot lights, and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use These cleaning recommendations may not be compliant with the rules of certain Air Quality Management Districts in California consult applicable rules before use Environmental Performance Humidity Resistance  High humidity has minimal effect on adhesive performance  No significant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for 7 days at 90F 32C and 90 relative humidity UV Resistance  When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely affected by exposure Water Resistance  Immersion in water has no appreciable effect on the bond strength After 100 hours

order requirements Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and improves bond strength To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unified Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane Note Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents These cleaning recommendations may not be in compliance with the rules of certain Air Quality Management Districts in California consult applicable rules before use IMPORTANT For optimum liner clarity on 3M Double Coated Polyester Tape 442F and 442DL products, it is recommended the tape product be processed from supplied roll format into converted product within six months of the manufacturing date After six months the liner clarity may be reduced due to a haze effect This liner clarity does not impact adhesive or liner performance over the shelf life of the product Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too firm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory Features   Polycoated paper liners and the polyester liners offer moisture stability    3M Double Coated Polyester Tapes 442F and 442DL double linered also offer an extended shelf life of an additional six months   Polyester film carrier at its center core which enhances the workability when laminating to various types of surfaces   Film also enhances the die cutability of the finished product   Provides clean removability from many surfaces Application Ideas These tapes are ideal for bonding together a wide variety of similar and dissimilar materials such as rubbers, metals, glass, papers, paints and many plastics Some application ideas include  Splicing of films, foils, papers, fabrics  Holding objects where high shear forces are encountered  Holding grinding and polishing pads  Miscellaneous joining and holding uses  3  Application Equipment Wide web lamination To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with

order requirements Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and improves bond strength To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unified Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane Note Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents These cleaning recommendations may not be in compliance with the rules of certain Air Quality Management Districts in California consult applicable rules before use IMPORTANT For optimum liner clarity on 3M Double Coated Polyester Tape 442F and 442DL products, it is recommended the tape product be processed from supplied roll format into converted product within six months of the manufacturing date After six months the liner clarity may be reduced due to a haze effect This liner clarity does not impact adhesive or liner performance over the shelf life of the product Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too firm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory Features   Polycoated paper liners and the polyester liners offer moisture stability    3M Double Coated Polyester Tapes 442F and 442DL double linered also offer an extended shelf life of an additional six months   Polyester film carrier at its center core which enhances the workability when laminating to various types of surfaces   Film also enhances the die cutability of the finished product   Provides clean removability from many surfaces Application Ideas These tapes are ideal for bonding together a wide variety of similar and dissimilar materials such as rubbers, metals, glass, papers, paints and many plastics Some application ideas include  Splicing of films, foils, papers, fabrics  Holding objects where high shear forces are encountered  Holding grinding and polishing pads  Miscellaneous joining and holding uses  3  Application Equipment Wide web lamination To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with

painted surfaces    Low surface energy plastic adhesion    Lens bonding applications Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100F 38C to 130F   54C, will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unied Typical cleaning solvents are methyl ethyl ketone for metals or isopropyl   alcohol for plastics Carefully read and follow manufacturers precautions and directions for use when using cleaning solvents   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of

Our custom fabricated 3M adhesives and tapes products can provide many solutions to countless applications using an array of different types of materials. Some of these solutions and benefits are listed below.</h4>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Replace Mechanical Fasteners</strong></h4>\n<p>Speed up your overall assembly process and improve product aesthetics and strength by replacing mechanical fasteners with 3M Adhesive Tape. Unlike screws and rivets, custom 3M Adhesive Tapes distribute stress evenly over the entire bonded area. With uniform stress distribution of adhesives and tapes, lighter and thinner materials can be used without having to worry about distortion, splitting, or crazing. This also reduces the chance for rust, corrosion, and water penetration. 3M Adhesives Tapes dampen vibration while imparting flexibility to a joint or bonded area for the ultimate hold.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Join Dissimilar Materials</strong></h4>\n<p>Enhance the performance of hard-to-bond surfaces and solve the adhesion challenges of dissimilar materials with 3M Adhesive Tapes and 3M Double Sided Adhesive Tapes. These materials bond to a wide range of substrates from metals, wood, glass, plastics and ceramics. This includes “hard to bond,” low surface energy materials.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Increase Speed and Productivity</strong><strong> </strong></h4>\n<p>Improve aesthetics and performance while boosting overall speed and productivity with 3M adhesives and tapes. Reduce process steps such as weld grinding and sealing individual penetrations from screws, nuts and bolts. Many tape and adhesive technologies require little operator training, reducing labor costs.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Improve appearance and aesthetics</strong></h4>\n<p>3M adhesive tape is generally hidden between the bonded substrates, offering nearly invisible fastening. Surfaces stay smooth and clean for a more attractive appearance and less surface refinishing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why Choose SRP For Custom 3M Adhesive Tape Products?</h3>\n<p>SRP has been a Preferred Converter of 3M products for over 25 years.
