PORON’s dense structure is made up of uniform microcells that allow it to bounce back to its original shape even after high force compression. PORON’s compression set resistance is comparable to that silicone rubber, which is why it’s a top choice for sealing and cushioning.What is Compression Force Deflection?Many materials measure the hardness or firmness by durometer. PORON materials are measured by the Compression Force Deflection (CFD), which shows how much force is needed to compress the material. The goal is to provide engineers and designers with specific data on how the material performs in their chosen application. To get started in choosing the right PORON material for your application, use the&nbsp;Compression Force Deflection (CFD) Curve Tool.Adhesive-backed PORONSRP is proud to be one of 60 Preferred Converter for Rogers Corporation materials.
