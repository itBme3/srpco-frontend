Peel values depend on plastic substrate  characteristics and/or paint composition. These values are for reference only.   Notes:    1.   The following technical information and data is based upon limited 3M testing conditions and should not be used  for specification purposes.    2.   Care should be taken to make sure the surface is clean and dry prior to application of the tape and not to saturate  the tape with strong polar solvents, like alcohols, after initial application.   3.   After adhesion build, the JLx adhesive is durable to typical automotive environmental conditions and chemicals and  provides a robust attachment solution.  For questions regarding the application process, please contact your 3M  technical representative.   4.   When using solvents, extinguish all ignition sources, including pilot lights and follow the manufacturer's precautions  and directions for use.

Peel and shear values depend  on plastic substrate characteristics and/or paint composition. These values are for reference only.    Note:   Care should be taken  to make sure the surface is clean and dry prior to application of the tape.   After  adhesion build, the adhesive is durable to typical automotive environmental conditions and chemicals and  provides a robust attachment solution.

This tape is specially designed for ex terior and interior parts attachments of automobiles.    The Acrylic Foam Tape can work well on the TOYOTA  Anti Acid Paint and Scratch Resistant Paint.      Features :  * To the TOYOTA Anti Acid Rain Pa int and Scratch Resistant Paint surface  a) Meets the TOYOTA specification of “The pressure  sensitive adhesive double coated t ape for exterior parts”, and      has a superior initial adhesion performance and durability.  b) Has the same workability as the  standard type on the conventional paint.  c) Doesn’t detach from the paint surface bec ause of a superior stress relaxation properties.  d) Still has a superior adhesion performance on the convent ional paint surface, and can be used for the same      applications as the standar d type acrylic foam tape.  *Follows the shrinkage and elongation of the plastic par t caused by the temperature change, and has good stress    relaxation properties which are very import ant for the automotive parts attachments.    *Provides a very high final adhesion and peeling strength.   *Excels in a variety of weather, so lvent and high temperature resistance.

Our custom fabricated 3M adhesives and tapes products can provide many solutions to countless applications using an array of different types of materials. Some of these solutions and benefits are listed below.Replace Mechanical FastenersSpeed up your overall assembly process and improve product aesthetics and strength by replacing mechanical fasteners with 3M Adhesive Tape. Unlike screws and rivets, custom 3M Adhesive Tapes distribute stress evenly over the entire bonded area. With uniform stress distribution of adhesives and tapes, lighter and thinner materials can be used without having to worry about distortion, splitting, or crazing. This also reduces the chance for rust, corrosion, and water penetration. 3M Adhesives Tapes dampen vibration while imparting flexibility to a joint or bonded area for the ultimate hold.Join Dissimilar MaterialsEnhance the performance of hard-to-bond surfaces and solve the adhesion challenges of dissimilar materials with 3M Adhesive Tapes and 3M Double Sided Adhesive Tapes. These materials bond to a wide range of substrates from metals, wood, glass, plastics and ceramics. This includes “hard to bond,” low surface energy materials.Increase Speed and Productivity Improve aesthetics and performance while boosting overall speed and productivity with 3M adhesives and tapes. Reduce process steps such as weld grinding and sealing individual penetrations from screws, nuts and bolts. Many tape and adhesive technologies require little operator training, reducing labor costs.Improve appearance and aesthetics3M adhesive tape is generally hidden between the bonded substrates, offering nearly invisible fastening. Surfaces stay smooth and clean for a more attractive appearance and less surface refinishing.&nbsp;Why Choose SRP For Custom 3M Adhesive Tape Products?SRP has been a Preferred Converter of 3M products for over 25 years. We provide our customers with everything from material sampling and product prototyping to full manufacturing, packaging, and delivery.
