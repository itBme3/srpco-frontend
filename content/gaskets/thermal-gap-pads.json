The viscoelastic nature of the material also gives excellent low-stress vibration dampening and shock absorbing characteristics. BERGQUIST GAP PAD TGP 1000VOUSB is an electrically isolating material, which allows its use in applications requiring isolation between eat sinks and high-voltage, bare-leaded devices.FEATURES AND BENEFITSThermal Conductivity: 1.0 W/m-KHighly Conformable, low hardness“Gel-like” modulusDecreased strainPuncture, shear and tear resistantElectrically isolatingBERGQUIST GAP PAD TGP 800VOBERGQUIST GAP PAD TGP 800VO is a cost-effective, thermally conductive interface material. The material is a filled, thermally conductive polymer supplied on a rubber-coated fiberglass carrier allowing for easy material handling. The conformable nature of BERGQUIST GAP PAD TGP 800VO allows the pad to fill in air gaps between PC boards and heat sinks or a metal chassis.FEATURES AND BENEFITSThermal Conductivity: 0.8 W/m-KEnhanced puncture, shear and tear resistanceConformable gap filling materialElectrically isolatingBERGQUIST SIL PAD TSP 900BERGQUIST® SIL PAD TSP 900 is a composite of silicone rubber and fiberglass. The material is flame retardant and is specially formulated for use as a thermally conductive insulator. The primary use for The Original Sil-Pad® Material is to electrically isolate power sources from heat sinks. BERGQUIST SIL PAD TSP 900 material has excellent mechanical and physical characteristics. Surfaces are pliable and allow complete surface contact with excellent heat dissipation. BERGQUIST SIL PAD TSP 900 actually improves its thermal resistance with age. The reinforcing fiberglass provides excellent cut-through resistance. In addition, BERGQUIST SIL PAD TSP 900 is non-toxic and resists damage from cleaning agents.FEATURES AND BENEFITSThermal impedance: 1.13°C-in2/W (@50 psi)Original Sil-Pad materialExcellent mechanical and physical characteristicsFlame retardant","order":12,"description":"BERGQUIST® brand materials are the world's most trusted thermal management products.
