Molded Rubber products.With two on-site laboratories and thousands of catalogued compounds, they are equipped to manufacture quality rubber products designed to meet the specifications and requirements of their application. Their in-house mixing capabilities keep your product under their tight control from the beginning. Their wide range and unique combination of manufacturing processes and capabilities make them your source for all of your rubber needs.Specification Grade Sheet RubberWARCO BILTRITE offers a complete line of Specification Grade Sheet Rubber that includes MIL-R and MIL-G Military Specifications, ASTM D 2000 Specifications, and Aerospace Material Specification (AMS).Neoprene Sheet RubberNeoprene is popular due to its unique combination of properties and has led to its use in thousands of applications in diverse environments. Neoprene is a polymer that provides moderate oil &amp; gasoline resistance, very good resistance to ozone &amp; sunlight, excellent adhesion to fabric &amp; metals, good resistance to abrasion &amp; flex cracking and very good resistance to alkalis &amp; acids.EPDM Sheet RubberEPDM provides superior properties for outdoor and high temperature applications. EPDM has excellent resistance to heat, ozone and sunlight and good resistance to alkalis, acids and oxygenated solvents. Very good temperature flexibility, superior resistance to water and steam. It is highly extendible and is sulfur and peroxide curable.Nitrile (NBR/Buna-N) Sheet RubberNitrile (NBR) is the polymer of choice for applications requiring oil and solvent resistance. Nitrile has very good oil and gasoline resistance, superior resistance to petroleum-based hydraulic fluids, a wide range of service temperatures, good resistance to hydrocarbon solvents, and very good resistance to alkalis and acids.SBR Sheet RubberSBR is a copolymer of styrene and butadiene and has properties similar to Natural Rubber. It has good abrasion resistance, excellent impact strength, very good resilience and a high tensile strength. The temperature range of SBR is -40˚F to 180˚F. SBR can be compounded for use as lining rubber, conveyor belt covers and other extremely demanding applications.Natural Rubber SheetNatural Rubber is a good gasket material due to excellent physical properties. Natural rubber has superior resilience, tensile, elongation and abrasion resistance, good low temperature flexibility and compression set and excellent adhesion to fabric and metals.Fluoroelastomer Sheet RubberFluoroelastomers were originally introduced over 50 years ago to meet the needs of the aerospace industry for a high-performance elastomer. Since then, the use of fluoroelastomers has spread quickly to many other industries, including the automotive, oil, fluid power, appliance and chemical industries and has developed a reputation for its outstanding performance in very hot and extremely corrosive environments. Fluoroelastomers are particularly valued for their excellent heat stability (200°C) and resistance to aggressive fuels and chemicals.Cloth–Inserted (CI) Sheet Rubber</p>","order":5,"description":"Manufacturing quality rubber products in the USA for over 100 years","type":"supplier","collectionType":"suppliers","totalConverters":null,"color":"purple_500"},{"id":48,"slug":"griswold","createdAt":"2022-01-23T21:43:22.709Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-28T05:25:49.933Z","publishedAt":"2019-11-07T23:34:54.000Z","title":"Griswold, LLC.","content":"<p>From vibration control to shock and impact absorption, sealing to non-skid solutions – you can count on their seasoned engineering team for deep expertise to help you create effective approaches and meet unique functional requirements.Griswold® enlighten-U® – Exceptional Long-Term Sealing and Cushioning PerformanceGriswold’s enlighten-U® microcellular urethane has excellent compression set resistance, predictable hardness, tight thickness tolerances and superior energy absorption properties, perfect for a variety of gasketing and sealing applications in the automotive/transportation, medical, polishing, flexographic printing and electronics industries.
