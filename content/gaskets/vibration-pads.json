Neoprene is a polymer that provides moderate oil &amp; gasoline resistance, very good resistance to ozone &amp; sunlight, excellent adhesion to fabric &amp; metals, good resistance to abrasion &amp; flex cracking and very good resistance to alkalis &amp; acids.EPDM Sheet RubberEPDM provides superior properties for outdoor and high temperature applications. EPDM has excellent resistance to heat, ozone and sunlight and good resistance to alkalis, acids and oxygenated solvents. Very good temperature flexibility, superior resistance to water and steam. It is highly extendible and is sulfur and peroxide curable.Nitrile (NBR/Buna-N) Sheet RubberNitrile (NBR) is the polymer of choice for applications requiring oil and solvent resistance. Nitrile has very good oil and gasoline resistance, superior resistance to petroleum-based hydraulic fluids, a wide range of service temperatures, good resistance to hydrocarbon solvents, and very good resistance to alkalis and acids.SBR Sheet RubberSBR is a copolymer of styrene and butadiene and has properties similar to Natural Rubber. It has good abrasion resistance, excellent impact strength, very good resilience and a high tensile strength. The temperature range of SBR is -40˚F to 180˚F. SBR can be compounded for use as lining rubber, conveyor belt covers and other extremely demanding applications.Natural Rubber SheetNatural Rubber is a good gasket material due to excellent physical properties. Natural rubber has superior resilience, tensile, elongation and abrasion resistance, good low temperature flexibility and compression set and excellent adhesion to fabric and metals.Fluoroelastomer Sheet RubberFluoroelastomers were originally introduced over 50 years ago to meet the needs of the aerospace industry for a high-performance elastomer. Since then, the use of fluoroelastomers has spread quickly to many other industries, including the automotive, oil, fluid power, appliance and chemical industries and has developed a reputation for its outstanding performance in very hot and extremely corrosive environments. Fluoroelastomers are particularly valued for their excellent heat stability (200°C) and resistance to aggressive fuels and chemicals.Cloth–Inserted (CI) Sheet Rubber</p>","order":5,"description":"Manufacturing quality rubber products in the USA for over 100 years","totalConverters":null,"color":"purple_500","createdAt":"2022-04-15T19:58:02.728Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-16T01:12:18.449Z","publishedAt":"2020-01-22T03:28:03.000Z"}],"id":55}
