200MP is 31F 35C Many applications survive  below this temperature factors aecting successful applications include materials being bonded, dwell at RT before cold exposure, and stress below the TG ie  expansioncontraction stresses, impact Optimum conditions are bonding high surface energy materials, longer time at RT before cold exposure, and little or no  stress below the TG The lowest service temperature is 40F 40C 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape 467MP HandlingApplication Information Application Examples  Long term bonding of graphic nameplates and overlays subsurface printed polycarbonate or polyester to metal and high surface energy plastics in the aerospace,  medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets   Bonding metal nameplates and rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets   Bonding graphic overlays for membrane switches and for bonding the complete switch to the equipment surface   High speed processing of parts in the medical, telecommunications and electronics markets medical components, durable labels, and exible circuits   Lamination to industrial foams for rotary diecutting of small gaskets for industrial and electronics markets Application Techniques For maximum bond strength during installation of the nal part the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried Typical cleaning solvents are heptane for oily  surfaces or isopropyl alcohol for plastics Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the  drying aect on skin and can interfere with the performance of a pressuresensitive adhesive  Note Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents These cleaning recommendations may not be in  compliance with the rules of certain air quality management districts in California consult applicable rules before use  It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination 1520 pli recommended and during nal part installation 1015 psi to allow the adhesive to come into direct  contact with the substrate Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of  lamination Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks For  plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat  The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 60F 156C to 100F 38C Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50F 10C  because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally  satisfactory please refer to section VII of the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics  When bonding a thin, smooth, exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of 3M Adhesive 200MP If a texture is visible on one or  both surfaces, the 5 mil 3M adhesive 200MP would be suggested If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the  components 3M VHB Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required please refer to the data page 70070938306  To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive  adhesives please refer to

35C Many applications survive   below this temperature factors aecting successful applications include materials being bonded, dwell at RT before cold exposure, and stress below the   TGieexpansioncontraction stresses, impact Optimum conditions are bonding high surface energy materials, longer time at RT before cold exposure, and little or   no stress below the TG The lowest service temperature is 40F 40C HandlingApplication Information Application Examples  Long term bonding of graphic nameplates and overlays subsurface printed polycarbonate or polyester to metal and high surface energy plastics in the aerospace,   medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets    Bonding metal nameplates and rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets    Bonding graphic overlays for membrane switches and for bonding the complete switch to the equipment surface    High speed processing of parts in the medical, telecommunications and electronics markets medical components, durable labels, and exible circuits    Lamination to industrial foams for rotary diecutting of small gaskets for industrial and electronics markets 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape 9668MP HandlingApplication Information continued Application Techniques For maximum bond strength during installation of the nal part the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried Typical cleaning solvents are heptane for oily   surfaces or isopropyl alcohol for plastics Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the   drying aect on skin and can interfere with the performance of a pressuresensitive adhesive   Note Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents These cleaning recommendations may not be in   compliance with the rules of certain air quality management districts in California consult applicable rules before use   It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination 1520 pli recommended and during nal part installation 1015 psi to allow the adhesive to come into direct   contact with the substrate Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of   lamination Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks For   plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat   The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 60F 156C to 100F 38C Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50F 10C   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory please refer to section VII of the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics   When bonding a thin, smooth, exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of 3M Adhesive 200MP If a texture is visible on one or   both surfaces, the 5 mil 3M adhesive 200MP would be suggested If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the   components 3M VHB Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required please refer to the data page 70070938306   To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives 70070414308 For additional dispenser information,

  ABS, Polycarbonate, Aluminum, Galvanized Steel 90C   Unplasticized PVC 75C Our testing has shown that 3M Adhesive 100MP yielded 92 retention of peel adhesion after the roll was aged for more than 5 years at an elevated temperature of   150F 65C The initial tack and liner release properties were still excellent This testing result suggests that the tape is relatively unaected by longterm exposure to   elevated temperatures Bonds made with 3M Adhesive 100MP can tolerate periodic shortterm exposures to temperatures up to 500F 260C   3M Adhesive 100MP is thermoplastic in nature, becoming softer as temperature increases and rmer as temperature decreases As the adhesive becomes rmer, the   performance generally increases This performance increase is demonstrated graphically in Figure 1 for 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9473PC It shows the   breakaway and peel forces as a function of temperature The exception of the performance increase is at very low temperatures when high impact stresses along with   high frequencies are encountered At low temperatures, the tape becomes very rm and glassy the ability to absorb impact energy is reduced 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9469PC Dynamic Mechanical Properties For engineers who have to use adhesive properties for modeling and analysis purpose, we suggest a Youngs modulus of 45  102 kPA measured at 23C  1 Hz and   a Poissons ratio of 0499 For detailed adhesive modulus and damping properties, please refer to the nomograph for 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tapes, which is   available upon request through our technical service group The nomograph presents adhesive modulus and damping properties as functions of temperature and   frequency Typical Performance Characteristics Additional Test notes 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tapes F9460PC, F9469PC, and F9473PC are made from the same adhesive system and are thermoplastic in nature, becoming softer   as temperature increases and rmer as temperature decreases As the adhesive becomes rmer, the adhesion performance generally increases At low temperatures   lower than 40F 40C, the 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape becomes very rm and glassy the ability to absorb impact energy is reduced In contrast,   adhesion strength reduces with increasing temperatures Typical adhesive strength properties at room temperatures are shown below Solvent Resistance No apparent degradation when exposed to

Information Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and improve   bond strength   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry, and well unied Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcoholwater mixture or   heptane   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory   Note Be sure to follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when using solvents Storage and Shelf Life Humidity controlled storage 60 to 80F 16 to 27C and 4060 RH   If stored properly, product retains its performance and properties for 24 months from date of manufacture If the products have been

rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronic markets    Lamination to foam for gasket application 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape 9472 HandlingApplication Information continued Application Techniques For maximum bond strength during installation of the nal part the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried Typical cleaning solvents are heptane for oily   surfaces or isopropyl alcohol for plastics Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the   drying eect on skin These oils can interfere with the performance of a pressuresensitive adhesive   Consult solvent manufacturers MSDS for proper handling and storage instructions Also, use disposable wipes that do not contain oils, to remove the cleaning solvents   It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination 1520 PLI recommended and during nal part installation 1015 PLI to allow to adhesive the come into direct   contact with the substrate Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of   lamination Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks For   plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat   The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 70F 21C to 100F 38C Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50F 10C   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory please refer to the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics section   When bonding a thin, smooth, exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of adhesive If a texture is visible on one or both surfaces,   the 5 mil adhesive would be suggested If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the components 3M VHB   Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required please refer to data page 70070938637 Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn

removed nameplates on a common sheet for ease of application    Attaching membrane switch assemblies to powder coated surfaces and low surface energy plastics    Graphic overlays with end tabs for easy liner removal    Graphic application to surfaces such as wood, fabric, plastic, where very high bond strength is required    Attaching identication material to lightly oily surfaces typical of machine parts Family Group 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape 9472LE HandlingApplication Information continued Application Techniques For maximum bond strength, the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried Typical cleaning solvents are methyl ethyl ketone for metals or isopropyl alcohol for   plastics Carefully read and follow manufacturers precautions and directions for use when using cleaning solvents   Bond strength can also be improved with rm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100F 38C to 130F 54C, causing the adhesive to develop intimate   contact with the bonding surface   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   for most pressuresensitive adhesives because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory Storage and Shelf Life Store at room temperature conditions of 70F 21C

Plasticizer Resistant Adhesive F9465PC Product Description 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape F9465PC is an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive which has been formulated   for bonding to many exible vinyls and provide outstanding resistance to the eects of plasticizer migration   from exible vinyls 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape with Plasticizer Resistant Adhesive F9465PC General Information Note Vinyl formulations dier and plasticizer types and amounts can vary The most common types ofPlasticized Vinyl contain low molecular weight materials   plasticizers which tend to migrate out of the vinyl In the case of adhesive bonding, these plasticizers migrate into the adhesive which can cause softening of the   adhesive and loss of bond strength over time    The possible eect of plasticizer migration on an adhesive bond can be predicted by accelerated aging for 5 days at elevated temperature 150F 65C Note Due   to the variability of vinyl formulations, we strongly recommend that the user test each vinyl substrate to determine suitability of the tape for the particular application    Natural and synthetic rubber materials such as neoprene and EPDM are also formulated with llers and plasticizers Note 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape F9465PC   does not resist the eects of these particular llers and plasticizers and is not recommended for use in bonding these materials Technical Information Note The

F9473PC Product Description Finite Element Analysis FEA  data is available for this product at  3mcomFEA 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9473PC utilizes the 3M High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 100MP,   which has excellent long term holding power with much higher adhesion strength than typical pressure   sensitive adhesive systems This 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape is transparent and is ideal for use in   many interior and exterior industrial applications to replace rivets, spot welds, liquid adhesives, and other   permanent fasteners 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9473PC Technical Information Note The following technical information and data should be considered representative or typical only and should not be used for specication purposes Typical Physical Properties Property Values Method

UL 746C listings with dierent temperature ratings on many commonly used substrate materials as indicated in the table below   Qualication for this listing requires high strength retention after extended exposure to high temperatures, humidity, cold, and cyclic conditions   Substrates Temperature Rating   Stainless Steel, GlassEpoxy, Enameled Steel, Ceramic, Phenolic 110C   ABS, Polycarbonate, Aluminum, Galvanized Steel 90C   Unplasticized PVC 75C Our testing has shown that 3M Adhesive 100MP yielded 92 retention of peel adhesion after the roll was aged for more than 5 years at an elevated temperature of   150F 65C The initial tack and liner release properties were still excellent This testing result suggests that the tape is relatively unaected by longterm exposure to   elevated temperatures Bonds made with 3M Adhesive 100MP can tolerate periodic shortterm exposures to temperatures up to 500F 260C   3M Adhesive 100MP is thermoplastic in nature, becoming softer as temperature increases and rmer as temperature decreases As the adhesive becomes rmer, the   performance generally increases This performance increase is demonstrated graphically in Figure 1 for 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9473PC It shows the   breakaway and peel forces as a function of temperature The exception of the performance increase is at very low temperatures when high impact stresses along with   high frequencies are encountered At low temperatures, the tape becomes very rm and glassy the ability to absorb impact energy is reduced Dynamic Mechanical Properties For engineers who have to use adhesive properties for modeling and analysis purpose, we suggest a Youngs modulus of 45  102 kPA measured at 23C  1 Hz and   a Poissons ratio of 0499 For detailed adhesive modulus and damping properties, please refer to the nomograph for 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tapes, which is   available upon request through our technical service group The nomograph presents adhesive modulus and damping properties as functions of temperature and   frequency 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9473PC Typical Performance Characteristics Additional Test notes 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tapes F9460PC,

adhesive contact and improve   bond strength   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry, and well unied Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcoholwater mixture or   heptane   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory   Note Be sure to follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when

Examples  Long term bonding of graphic nameplates and overlays subsurface printed polycarbonate or polyester to metal and high surface energy plastics in the aerospace,   medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets    Bonding metal nameplates and rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets    Bonding graphic overlays for membrane switches and for bonding the complete switch to the equipment surface    High speed processing of parts in the medical, telecommunications and electronics markets medical components, durable labels, and exible circuits    Lamination to industrial foams for rotary diecutting of small gaskets for industrial and electronics markets Application Techniques For maximum bond strength during installation of the nal part the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried Typical cleaning solvents are heptane for oily   surfaces or isopropyl alcohol for plastics Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the   drying aect on skin and can interfere with the performance of a pressuresensitive adhesive   Note Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents These cleaning recommendations may not be in   compliance with the rules of certain air quality management districts in California consult applicable rules before use   It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination 1520 pli recommended and during nal part installation 1015 psi to allow the adhesive to come into direct   contact with the substrate Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of   lamination Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks For   plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat   The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 60F 156C to 100F 38C Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50F 10C   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory please refer to section VII of the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics   When bonding a thin, smooth, exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of 3M Adhesive 200MP If a texture is visible on one or   both surfaces, the 5 mil 3M adhesive 200MP would be suggested If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the   components 3M VHB Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required please refer to the data page 70070938306   To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating

after exposure for 7 days at 90F   32C and 90 relative humidity   UV Resistance  When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely aected by outdoor exposure   Water Resistance  Immersion in water has no appreciable eect on the bond strength After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained   Temperature Cycling Resistance  High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through             4 hours at 158F 70C             4 hours at 20F 29C             4 hours at 73F 22C   Chemical Resistance  When properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids   and alkalis   Bond Buildup The bond strength of 3M High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP increases as a function of time and temperature   TemperatureHeat Resistance 3M High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP is usable for short periods minutes, hours at temperatures up to400F 204C and   for intermittent longer periods days, weeks up to 300F 149C   Lower Temperature Service Limit The glass transition temperature for 3M High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP is 31F 35C Many applications survive   below this temperature factors aecting successful applications include materials being bonded, dwell at RT before cold exposure, and stress below the   TGieexpansioncontraction stresses, impact Optimum conditions are bonding high surface energy materials, longer time at RT before cold exposure, and little or   no stress below the TG The lowest service temperature is 40F 40C HandlingApplication Information Application Examples  Long term bonding of graphic nameplates and overlays subsurface printed polycarbonate or polyester to metal and high surface energy plastics in the aerospace,   medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets    Bonding metal nameplates and rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets    Bonding graphic overlays for membrane switches and for bonding the complete switch to the equipment surface    High speed processing of parts in the medical, telecommunications and electronics markets medical components, durable labels, and exible circuits    Lamination to industrial foams for rotary diecutting of small gaskets for industrial and electronics markets 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape 9667MP HandlingApplication Information continued Application Techniques For maximum bond strength during installation of the nal part the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried Typical cleaning solvents are heptane for oily   surfaces or isopropyl alcohol for plastics Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the   drying aect on skin and can interfere with the performance of a pressuresensitive adhesive   Note Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents These cleaning recommendations may not be in   compliance with the rules of certain air quality management districts in California consult applicable rules before use   It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination 1520 pli recommended and during nal part installation 1015 psi to allow the adhesive to come into direct   contact with the substrate Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of   lamination Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks For   plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat   The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 60F 156C to 100F 38C Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50F 10C   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory please refer to section VII of the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics   When bonding a thin, smooth, exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of 3M Adhesive 200MP If a texture is visible on one or   both surfaces, the 5 mil 3M adhesive 200MP would be suggested If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the   components 3M VHB Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required please refer to the data page 70070938306   To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives 70070414308 For additional dispenser information,   contact your local 3M sales representative, or the toll free 3M sales assistance number at 18003623550 Storage and Shelf Life It is suggested that products are stored at room temperature conditions of

dried Typical cleaning solvents are methyl ethyl ketone for metals or isopropyl alcohol for   plastics Carefully read and follow manufacturers precautions and directions for use when using cleaning solvents   Bond strength can also be improved with rm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100F 38C to 130F 54C, causing the adhesive to develop intimate   contact with the bonding surface   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   for most pressuresensitive adhesives because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory Storage and Shelf Life Store at room temperature conditions of 70F 21C

rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronic markets    Lamination to foam for gasket application 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape 9471 HandlingApplication Information continued Application Techniques For maximum bond strength during installation of the nal part the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried Typical cleaning solvents are heptane for oily   surfaces or isopropyl alcohol for plastics Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the   drying eect on skin These oils can interfere with the performance of a pressuresensitive adhesive   Consult solvent manufacturers MSDS for proper handling and storage instructions Also, use disposable wipes that do not contain oils, to remove the cleaning solvents   It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination 1520 PLI recommended and during nal part installation 1015 PLI to allow to adhesive the come into direct   contact with the substrate Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of   lamination Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks For   plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat   The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 70F 21C to 100F 38C Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50F 10C   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory please refer to the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics section   When bonding a thin, smooth, exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of adhesive If a texture is visible on one or both surfaces,   the 5 mil adhesive would be suggested If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the components 3M VHB   Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required please refer to data page 70070938637 Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn

F9460PC Product Description Finite Element Analysis FEA  data is available for this product at  3mcomFEA 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9460PC utilizes the 3M High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 100MP,   which has excellent long term holding power with much higher adhesion strength than typical pressure   sensitive adhesive systems This 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape is transparent and is ideal for use in   many interior and exterior industrial applications to replace rivets, spot welds, liquid adhesives, and other   permanent fasteners 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9460PC Technical Information Note The following technical information and data should be considered representative or typical only and should not be used for specication purposes Typical Physical Properties Property Values Method

has UL 746C listings with dierent temperature ratings on many commonly used substrate materials as indicated in the table below   Qualication for this listing requires high strength retention after extended exposure to high temperatures, humidity, cold, and cyclic conditions   Substrates Temperature Rating   Stainless Steel, GlassEpoxy, Enameled Steel, Ceramic, Phenolic 110C   ABS, Polycarbonate, Aluminum, Galvanized Steel 90C   Unplasticized PVC 75C Our testing has shown that 3M Adhesive 100MP yielded 92 retention of peel adhesion after the roll was aged for more than 5 years at an elevated temperature of   150F 65C The initial tack and liner release properties were still excellent This testing result suggests that the tape is relatively unaected by longterm exposure to   elevated temperatures Bonds made with 3M Adhesive 100MP can tolerate periodic shortterm exposures to temperatures up to 500F 260C   3M Adhesive 100MP is thermoplastic in nature, becoming softer as temperature increases and rmer as temperature decreases As the adhesive becomes rmer, the   performance generally increases This performance increase is demonstrated graphically in Figure 1 for 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9473PC It shows the   breakaway and peel forces as a function of temperature The exception of the performance increase is at very low temperatures when high impact stresses along with   high frequencies are encountered At low temperatures, the tape becomes very rm and glassy the ability to absorb impact energy is reduced Dynamic Mechanical Properties For engineers who have to use adhesive properties for modeling and analysis purpose, we suggest a Youngs modulus of 45  102 kPA measured at 23C  1 Hz and   a Poissons ratio of 0499 For detailed adhesive modulus and damping properties, please refer to the nomograph for 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tapes, which is   available upon request through our technical service group The nomograph presents adhesive modulus and damping properties as functions of temperature and   frequency 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9460PC Typical Performance Characteristics Additional Test notes 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tapes F9460PC, F9469PC, and F9473PC are made from the same adhesive system and are thermoplastic in nature, becoming softer   as temperature increases and rmer as temperature decreases As the adhesive becomes rmer, the adhesion performance generally increases At low temperatures   lower than 40F 40C, the 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape becomes very rm and glassy the ability to absorb impact energy is reduced In contrast,   adhesion strength reduces with increasing temperatures Typical adhesive strength properties at room temperatures are shown below Solvent Resistance No apparent degradation when exposed to

developed Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and improve   bond strength   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry, and well unied Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcoholwater mixture or   heptane   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory   Note Be sure to follow the

permanent, 3M adhesive tape can be readily matched to the substrate and stress characteristics needed in the joint. Our custom fabricated 3M adhesives and tapes products can provide many solutions to countless applications using an array of different types of materials. Some of these solutions and benefits are listed below.</h4>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Replace Mechanical Fasteners</strong></h4>\n<p>Speed up your overall assembly process and improve product aesthetics and strength by replacing mechanical fasteners with 3M Adhesive Tape. Unlike screws and rivets, custom 3M Adhesive Tapes distribute stress evenly over the entire bonded area. With uniform stress distribution of adhesives and tapes, lighter and thinner materials can be used without having to worry about distortion, splitting, or crazing. This also reduces the chance for rust, corrosion, and water penetration. 3M Adhesives Tapes dampen vibration while imparting flexibility to a joint or bonded area for the ultimate hold.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Join Dissimilar Materials</strong></h4>\n<p>Enhance the performance of hard-to-bond surfaces and solve the adhesion challenges of dissimilar materials with 3M Adhesive Tapes and 3M Double Sided Adhesive Tapes. These materials bond to a wide range of substrates from metals, wood, glass, plastics and ceramics. This includes ‚Äúhard to bond,‚Äù low surface energy materials.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Increase Speed and Productivity</strong><strong>¬†</strong></h4>\n<p>Improve aesthetics and performance while boosting overall speed and productivity with 3M adhesives and tapes.¬†Reduce process steps such as weld grinding and sealing individual penetrations from screws, nuts and bolts. Many tape and adhesive technologies require little operator training, reducing labor costs.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Improve appearance and aesthetics</strong></h4>\n<p>3M adhesive tape is generally hidden between the bonded substrates, offering nearly invisible fastening. Surfaces stay smooth and clean for a more attractive appearance and less surface refinishing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why Choose SRP For Custom 3M Adhesive Tape Products?</h3>\n<p>SRP has been a Preferred Converter of 3M products for over 25 years.
