200MP is 31F 35C Many applications survive  below this temperature factors aecting successful applications include materials being bonded, dwell at RT before cold exposure, and stress below the TG ie  expansioncontraction stresses, impact Optimum conditions are bonding high surface energy materials, longer time at RT before cold exposure, and little or no  stress below the TG The lowest service temperature is 40F 40C 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape 467MP HandlingApplication Information Application Examples  Long term bonding of graphic nameplates and overlays subsurface printed polycarbonate or polyester to metal and high surface energy plastics in the aerospace,  medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets   Bonding metal nameplates and rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets   Bonding graphic overlays for membrane switches and for bonding the complete switch to the equipment surface   High speed processing of parts in the medical, telecommunications and electronics markets medical components, durable labels, and exible circuits   Lamination to industrial foams for rotary diecutting of small gaskets for industrial and electronics markets Application Techniques For maximum bond strength during installation of the nal part the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried Typical cleaning solvents are heptane for oily  surfaces or isopropyl alcohol for plastics Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the  drying aect on skin and can interfere with the performance of a pressuresensitive adhesive  Note Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents These cleaning recommendations may not be in  compliance with the rules of certain air quality management districts in California consult applicable rules before use  It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination 1520 pli recommended and during nal part installation 1015 psi to allow the adhesive to come into direct  contact with the substrate Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of  lamination Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks For  plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat  The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 60F 156C to 100F 38C Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50F 10C  because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally  satisfactory please refer to section VII of the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics  When bonding a thin, smooth, exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of 3M Adhesive 200MP If a texture is visible on one or  both surfaces, the 5 mil 3M adhesive 200MP would be suggested If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the  components 3M VHB Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required please refer to the data page 70070938306  To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive  adhesives please refer to

Service Limit The glass transition temperature for 3M High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP is 31F 35C Many applications survive   below this temperature factors aecting successful applications include materials being bonded, dwell at RT before cold exposure, and stress below the TG ie   expansioncontraction stresses, impact Optimum conditions are bonding high surface energy materials, longer time at RT before cold exposure, and little or no   stress below the TG The lowest service temperature is 40F 40C 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape 468MP HandlingApplication Information Application Examples  Long term bonding of graphic nameplates and overlays subsurface printed polycarbonate or polyester to metal and high surface energy plastics in the aerospace,   medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets    Bonding metal nameplates and rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets    Bonding graphic overlays for membrane switches and for bonding the complete switch to the equipment surface    High speed processing of parts in the medical, telecommunications and electronics markets medical components, durable labels, and exible circuits    Lamination to industrial foams for rotary diecutting of small gaskets for industrial and electronics markets Application Techniques For maximum bond strength during installation of the nal part the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried Typical cleaning solvents are heptane for oily   surfaces or isopropyl alcohol for plastics Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the   drying aect on skin and can interfere with the performance of a pressuresensitive adhesive   Note Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents These cleaning recommendations may not be in   compliance with the rules of certain air quality management districts in California consult applicable rules before use   It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination 1520 pli recommended and during nal part installation 1015 psi to allow the adhesive to come into direct   contact with the substrate Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of   lamination Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks For   plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat   The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 60F 156C to 100F 38C Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50F 10C   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory please refer to section VII of the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics   When bonding a thin, smooth, exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of 3M Adhesive 200MP If a texture is visible on one or   both surfaces, the 5 mil 3M adhesive 200MP would be suggested If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the   components 3M VHB Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required please refer to the data page 70070938306   To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives 70070414308 For additional dispenser information,   contact your local 3M sales representative, or the toll free 3M sales assistance number at 18003623550 Storage and Shelf Life It is

overlays to surfaces such as metal and low surface energy plastics in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment,   automotive, appliance and electronic markets    Bonding metal nameplates and rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronic markets    Lamination to foam for gasket application 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape 9472 HandlingApplication Information continued Application Techniques For maximum bond strength during installation of the nal part the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried Typical cleaning solvents are heptane for oily   surfaces or isopropyl alcohol for plastics Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the   drying eect on skin These oils can interfere with the performance of a pressuresensitive adhesive   Consult solvent manufacturers MSDS for proper handling and storage instructions Also, use disposable wipes that do not contain oils, to remove the cleaning solvents   It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination 1520 PLI recommended and during nal part installation 1015 PLI to allow to adhesive the come into direct   contact with the substrate Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of   lamination Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks For   plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat   The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 70F 21C to 100F 38C Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50F 10C   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory please refer to the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics section   When bonding a thin, smooth, exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of adhesive If a texture is visible on one or both surfaces,   the 5 mil adhesive would be suggested If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the components 3M VHB   Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required please refer to data page 70070938637 Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives 70070414308   For additional dispenser

Plasticizer Resistant Adhesive F9465PC Product Description 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape F9465PC is an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive which has been formulated   for bonding to many exible vinyls and provide outstanding resistance to the eects of plasticizer migration   from exible vinyls 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape with Plasticizer Resistant Adhesive F9465PC General Information Note Vinyl formulations dier and plasticizer types and amounts can vary The most common types ofPlasticized Vinyl contain low molecular weight materials   plasticizers which tend to migrate out of the vinyl In the case of adhesive bonding, these plasticizers migrate into the adhesive which can cause softening of the   adhesive and loss of bond strength over time    The possible eect of plasticizer migration on an adhesive bond can be predicted by accelerated aging for 5 days at elevated temperature 150F 65C Note Due   to the variability of vinyl formulations, we strongly recommend that the user test each vinyl substrate to determine suitability of the tape for the particular application    Natural and synthetic rubber materials such as neoprene and EPDM are also formulated with llers and plasticizers Note 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape F9465PC   does not resist the eects of these particular llers and plasticizers and is not recommended for use in bonding these materials Technical Information Note The

strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and improves   bond strength   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unied Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane   Note Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of

applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids and alkalis Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100F 38C to 130F 54C, will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unified Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane  Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too firm to adhere readily However, once properly applied,

 Double Coated Tapes with 9492MP   9495MP   9495MPF   9495B Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100F 38C to 130F 54C, will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unified Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane  Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too firm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory Note Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents These cleaning recommendations may not be compliant with the rules of certain Air Quality Management Districts in California consult applicable rules before use Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working
