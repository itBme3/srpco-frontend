Bond strength shows no signi\u0000cant reduction after exposure for 7 days at 90°F   (32°C) and 90% relative humidity.   UV Resistance – When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely a\u0000ected by outdoor exposure.   Water Resistance – Immersion in water has no appreciable e\u0000ect on the bond strength. After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained.   Temperature Cycling Resistance – High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through:             4 hours at 158°F (70°C)             4 hours at -20°F (-29°C)             4 hours at 73°F (22°C)   Chemical Resistance – When properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids   and alkalis.   Bond Build-up: The bond strength of 3M™ High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP increases as a function of time and temperature   Temperature/Heat Resistance: 3M™ High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP is usable for short periods (minutes, hours) at temperatures up to400°F (204°C) and   for intermittent longer periods (days, weeks) up to 300°F (149°C).   Lower Temperature Service Limit: The glass transition temperature for 3M™ High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP is -31°F (-35°C). Many applications survive   below this temperature (factors a\u0000ecting successful applications include: materials being bonded, dwell at RT before cold exposure, and stress below the TG [i.e.   expansion/contraction stresses, impact]). Optimum conditions are: bonding high surface energy materials, longer time at RT before cold exposure, and little or no   stress below the TG. The lowest service temperature is -40°F (-40°C). 3M™ Adhesive Transfer Tape 467MP Handling/Application Information Application Examples • Long term bonding of graphic nameplates and overlays (“subsurface” printed polycarbonate or polyester) to metal and high surface energy plastics in the aerospace,   medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets.   • Bonding metal nameplates and rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets.   • Bonding graphic overlays for membrane switches and for bonding the complete switch to the equipment surface.   • High speed processing of parts in the medical, telecommunications and electronics markets (medical components, durable labels, and \u0000exible circuits).   • Lamination to industrial foams for rotary die-cutting of small gaskets for industrial and electronics markets. Application Techniques For maximum bond strength (during installation of the \u0000nal part) the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried. Typical cleaning solvents are heptane (for oily   surfaces) or isopropyl alcohol for plastics. Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the   drying a\u0000ect on skin and can interfere with the performance of a pressure-sensitive adhesive.   *Note: Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when working with solvents. These cleaning recommendations may not be in   compliance with the rules of certain air quality management districts in California; consult applicable rules before use.   It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination (1.5-20 pli recommended) and during \u0000nal part installation (10-15 psi) to allow the adhesive to come into direct   contact with the substrate. Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of   lamination. Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts (generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks). For   plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat.   The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 60°F (15.6°C) to 100°F (38°C). Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50°F (10°C)   because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory (please refer to section VII of the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics).   When bonding a thin, smooth, \u0000exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of 3M™ Adhesive 200MP. If a texture is visible on one or   both surfaces, the 5 mil 3M adhesive 200MP would be suggested. If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the   components. 3M™ VHB™ Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required (please refer to the data page 70-0709-3830-6).   To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality. To learn more about working with pressure-sensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives (70-0704-1430-8).

Bond strength shows no signi\u0000cant reduction after exposure for 7 days at 90°F   (32°C) and 90% relative humidity.   UV Resistance – When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely a\u0000ected by outdoor exposure.   Water Resistance – Immersion in water has no appreciable e\u0000ect on the bond strength. After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained.   Temperature Cycling Resistance – High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through:             4 hours at 158°F (70°C)             4 hours at -20°F (-29°C)             4 hours at 73°F (22°C)   Chemical Resistance – When properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids   and alkalis.   Bond Build-up: The bond strength of 3M™ High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP increases as a function of time and temperature   Temperature/Heat Resistance: 3M™ High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP is usable for short periods (minutes, hours) at temperatures up to400°F (204°C) and   for intermittent longer periods (days, weeks) up to 300°F (149°C).   Lower Temperature Service Limit: The glass transition temperature for 3M™ High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP is -31°F (-35°C). Many applications survive   below this temperature (factors a\u0000ecting successful applications include: materials being bonded, dwell at RT before cold exposure, and stress below the TG [i.e.   expansion/contraction stresses, impact]). Optimum conditions are: bonding high surface energy materials, longer time at RT before cold exposure, and little or no   stress below the TG. The lowest service temperature is -40°F (-40°C). 3M™ Adhesive Transfer Tape 468MP Handling/Application Information Application Examples • Long term bonding of graphic nameplates and overlays (“subsurface” printed polycarbonate or polyester) to metal and high surface energy plastics in the aerospace,   medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets.   • Bonding metal nameplates and rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets.   • Bonding graphic overlays for membrane switches and for bonding the complete switch to the equipment surface.   • High speed processing of parts in the medical, telecommunications and electronics markets (medical components, durable labels, and \u0000exible circuits).   • Lamination to industrial foams for rotary die-cutting of small gaskets for industrial and electronics markets. Application Techniques For maximum bond strength (during installation of the \u0000nal part) the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried. Typical cleaning solvents are heptane (for oily   surfaces) or isopropyl alcohol for plastics. Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the   drying a\u0000ect on skin and can interfere with the performance of a pressure-sensitive adhesive.   *Note: Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when working with solvents. These cleaning recommendations may not be in   compliance with the rules of certain air quality management districts in California; consult applicable rules before use.   It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination (1.5-20 pli recommended) and during \u0000nal part installation (10-15 psi) to allow the adhesive to come into direct   contact with the substrate. Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of   lamination. Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts (generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks). For   plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat.   The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 60°F (15.6°C) to 100°F (38°C). Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50°F (10°C)   because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory (please refer to section VII of the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics).   When bonding a thin, smooth, \u0000exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of 3M™ Adhesive 200MP. If a texture is visible on one or   both surfaces, the 5 mil 3M adhesive 200MP would be suggested. If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the   components. 3M™ VHB™ Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required (please refer to the data page 70-0709-3830-6).   To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality. To learn more about working with pressure-sensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives (70-0704-1430-8).

Bond Build-up: The bond strength of 3M™ Adhesive 300 increases as a function of time and temperature   Temperature/Heat Resistance: Adhesive 300 is usable for short periods (minutes, hours) at temperatures up to 250°F (120°C) and for intermittent longer periods (days,   weeks) up to 150°F (65°C).   Lower Temperature Service Limit: -40F (-40°C). Handling/Application Information Application Examples • Long term bonding of graphic nameplates and overlays to surfaces such as metal and low surface energy plastics in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment,   automotive, appliance and electronic markets.   • Bonding metal nameplates and rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronic markets.   • Lamination to foam for gasket application. 3M™ Adhesive Transfer Tape 9472 Handling/Application Information (continued) Application Techniques For maximum bond strength (during installation of the \u0000nal part) the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried. Typical cleaning solvents are heptane (for oily   surfaces) or isopropyl alcohol for plastics. Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the   drying e\u0000ect on skin These oils can interfere with the performance of a pressure-sensitive adhesive.   Consult solvent manufacturers MSDS for proper handling and storage instructions. Also, use disposable wipes that do not contain oils, to remove the cleaning solvents.   It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination (1.5-20 PLI recommended) and during \u0000nal part installation (10-15 PLI) to allow to adhesive the come into direct   contact with the substrate. Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of   lamination. Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts (generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks). For   plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat.   The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 70°F (21°C) to 100°F (38°C). Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50°F (10°C)   because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory (please refer to the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics section).   When bonding a thin, smooth, \u0000exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of adhesive. If a texture is visible on one or both surfaces,   the 5 mil adhesive would be suggested. If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the components. 3M™ VHB™   Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required (please refer to data page 70-0709-3863-7). Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality. To learn more about working with pressure-sensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives (70-0704-1430-8).

Family Group 3M™ Adhesive Transfer Tape 9471LE Handling/Application Information (continued) Application Techniques For maximum bond strength, the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried. Typical cleaning solvents are methyl ethyl ketone for metals or isopropyl alcohol for   plastics. Carefully read and follow manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when using cleaning solvents.   Bond strength can also be improved with \u0000rm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100°F (38°C) to 130°F (54°C), causing the adhesive to develop intimate   contact with the bonding surface.   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended   for most pressure-sensitive adhesives because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory. Storage and Shelf Life Store at room temperature conditions of 70°F (21°C) and 50% relative humidity.

Bond Build-up: The bond strength of 3M™ Adhesive 300LSE increased as a function of time and temperature, and has very high initial adhesion.   Humidity Resistance: High humidity has a minimal e\u0000ect on adhesive performance. No signi\u0000cant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for 7 days at   90°F (32°C) and 90% relative humidity.   U.V. Resistance: When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely a\u0000ected by exposure.   Water Resistance: Immersion in water has no appreciable e\u0000ect on the bond strength. After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained.   Temperature Cycling Resistance: High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through:             4 hours at 158°F (70°C)             4 hours at -20°F (-29°C)             4 hours at 73°F (22°C)   Chemical Resistance: When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids   and alkalis.   Temperature Resistance: 3M™ Adhesive 300LSE is usable for short periods (minutes, hours) at temperatures up to 300°F (148°C) and for intermittent longer periods   of time (days, weeks) up to 200°F (93°C).   Lower Service Temperature: -40°F (-40°C). Processing Slitting and die-cutting: This adhesive is very aggressive and may be di\u0000cult to convert depending on your application requirements. Chilling the adhesive between   35°F and 50°F will improve the processability. In addition, dies can be lubricated with evaporative stamping oil. You may also refer to our Technical Bulletin on 3M™   Adhesive 300LSE converting. (70-0707-6205-2)   Roll Laminating: A combination of metal and rubber rollers with moderate pressure is recommended. Note: Please refer to the Technical Bulletin on slitting. (70-0709- 3905-6) Handling/Application Information Application Examples • Plastic nameplates or graphic overlays for use on low surface energy plastics.   • Waste removed nameplates on a common sheet for ease of application.   • Attaching membrane switch assemblies to powder coated surfaces and low surface energy plastics.   • Graphic overlays with end tabs for easy liner removal.   • Graphic application to surfaces such as wood, fabric, plastic, where very high bond strength is required.   • Attaching identi\u0000cation material to lightly oily surfaces typical of machine parts. Family Group 3M™ Adhesive Transfer Tape 9472LE Handling/Application Information (continued) Application Techniques For maximum bond strength, the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried. Typical cleaning solvents are methyl ethyl ketone for metals or isopropyl alcohol for   plastics. Carefully read and follow manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when using cleaning solvents.   Bond strength can also be improved with \u0000rm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100°F (38°C) to 130°F (54°C), causing the adhesive to develop intimate   contact with the bonding surface.   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended   for most pressure-sensitive adhesives because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory. Storage and Shelf Life Store at room temperature conditions of 70°F (21°C) and 50% relative humidity.   If stored properly, product retains its performance and properties for 24 months from date of manufacture. Trademarks 3M is a trademark of 3M Company.

The most common types ofPlasticized Vinyl contain low molecular weight materials   (plasticizers) which tend to migrate out of the vinyl. In the case of adhesive bonding, these plasticizers migrate into the adhesive which can cause softening of the   adhesive and loss of bond strength over time.   • The possible e\u0000ect of plasticizer migration on an adhesive bond can be predicted by accelerated aging for 5 days at elevated temperature (150°F [65°C]). Note: Due   to the variability of vinyl formulations, we strongly recommend that the user test each vinyl substrate to determine suitability of the tape for the particular application.   • Natural and synthetic rubber materials such as neoprene and EPDM are also formulated with \u0000llers and plasticizers. Note: 3M™ Adhesive Transfer Tape F-9465PC   does not resist the e\u0000ects of these particular \u0000llers and plasticizers and is not recommended for use in bonding these materials.

Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and improves   bond strength.   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well uni\u0000ed. Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane.   Note: Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when working with solvents.   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory. Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality. To learn more about working with pressure-sensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives (70-0704-1430-8).   For additional dispenser information, contact your local 3M sales representative, or the toll free 3M sales assistance number at 1-800-362-3550. Storage and Shelf Life It is best to use the rolls as soon as possible after receipt. Ideally, rolls should be laminated to the intended substrates as soon after receipt as possible. Store in original   cartons at 70°F (21°C) and 50% relative humidity. When storing rolls, lay them \u0000at in a horizontal position with release treated wafers between the rolls.   If stored under proper conditions, product retains its performance and properties for 24 months from date of manufacture. Trademarks 3M is a trademark of 3M Company.

No significant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for seven days at 90°F (32°C) and 90% relative humidity. UV Resistance: When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely affected by exposure to direct sunlight. Water Resistance: Immersion in water has no appreciable effect on the bond strength. After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained. Temperature Cycling Resistance: High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through: 4 hours at 158°F (70°C) 4 hours at -20°F (-29°C) 4 hours at 73°F (22°C) Chemical Resistance: When properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids and alkalis. Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100°F (38°C) to 130°F (54°C), will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface. To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unified. Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane. * Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too firm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory. *Note: Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when working with solvents. These cleaning recommendations may not be compliant with the rules of certain Air Quality Management Districts in California; consult applicable rules before use.

Family Group Table continued on next page 3M™ Double Coated Tape 9495LE Handling/Application Information Application Examples • Foam to powder coated painted surfaces.   • Low surface energy plastic adhesion.   • Lens bonding applications Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100°F (38°C) to 130°F   (54°C), will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface.   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well uni\u0000ed. Typical cleaning solvents are methyl ethyl ketone for metals or isopropyl   alcohol for plastics. Carefully read and follow manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when using cleaning solvents.   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory. Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality. To learn more about working with pressure-sensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives (70-0704-1430-8).

Adding Liners to 3M ™ Double Coated Tapes with 3M ™ Laminating Adhesive 200MP 1.  Rotary processing, tape only, on a densified (outside of #4994) kraft liner. In this process the tape waste will stay with the 58# PCK liner, leaving adhesive die-cuts dispensable from the #4994 (densified kraft) liner. 2.  Rotary processing for finished parts. It is most efficient to use the polyester linered double coat (3M™ Double Coated Tape 9495MPF). Current process limitations prevent the supply of the 3M™ Laminating Adhesive 200MP on a DK liner. Environmental Performance Humidity Resistance: High humidity has minimal effect on adhesive performance. No significant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for seven days at 90°F (32°C) and 90% relative humidity. UV Resistance: When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely affected by exposure to direct sunlight. Water Resistance: Immersion in water has no appreciable effect on the bond strength. After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained. Temperature Cycling Resistance: High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through: 4 hours at 158°F (70°C) 4 hours at -20°F (-29°C) 4 hours at 73°F (22°C) Chemical Resistance: When properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids and alkalis.

Available Lengths (Subject to minimum order requirements) (3) 3M ™ Double Coated Tapes with 9492MP •  9495MP •  9495MPF •  9495B Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100°F (38°C) to 130°F (54°C), will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface. To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unified. Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane. * Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too firm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory. *Note: Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when working with solvents. These cleaning recommendations may not be compliant with the rules of certain Air Quality Management Districts in California; consult applicable rules before use. Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality. To learn more about working with pressure-sensitive adhesives please refer to technical bulletin,  Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives (70-0704-1430-8).

Adding Liners to 3M ™ Double Coated Tapes with 3M ™ Laminating Adhesive 200MP 1.  Rotary processing, tape only, on a densified (outside of #4994) kraft liner. In this process the tape waste will stay with the 58# PCK liner, leaving adhesive die-cuts dispensable from the #4994 (densified kraft) liner. 2.  Rotary processing for finished parts. It is most efficient to use the polyester linered double coat (3M™ Double Coated Tape 9495MPF). Current process limitations prevent the supply of the 3M™ Laminating Adhesive 200MP on a DK liner. Environmental Performance Humidity Resistance: High humidity has minimal effect on adhesive performance. No significant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for seven days at 90°F (32°C) and 90% relative humidity. UV Resistance: When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely affected by exposure to direct sunlight. Water Resistance: Immersion in water has no appreciable effect on the bond strength. After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained. Temperature Cycling Resistance: High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through: 4 hours at 158°F (70°C) 4 hours at -20°F (-29°C) 4 hours at 73°F (22°C) Chemical Resistance: When properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids and alkalis.
