Our custom fabricated 3M adhesives and tapes products can provide many solutions to countless applications using an array of different types of materials. Some of these solutions and benefits are listed below.Replace Mechanical FastenersSpeed up your overall assembly process and improve product aesthetics and strength by replacing mechanical fasteners with 3M Adhesive Tape. Unlike screws and rivets, custom 3M Adhesive Tapes distribute stress evenly over the entire bonded area. With uniform stress distribution of adhesives and tapes, lighter and thinner materials can be used without having to worry about distortion, splitting, or crazing. This also reduces the chance for rust, corrosion, and water penetration. 3M Adhesives Tapes dampen vibration while imparting flexibility to a joint or bonded area for the ultimate hold.Join Dissimilar MaterialsEnhance the performance of hard-to-bond surfaces and solve the adhesion challenges of dissimilar materials with 3M Adhesive Tapes and 3M Double Sided Adhesive Tapes. These materials bond to a wide range of substrates from metals, wood, glass, plastics and ceramics. This includes “hard to bond,” low surface energy materials.Increase Speed and Productivity Improve aesthetics and performance while boosting overall speed and productivity with 3M adhesives and tapes. Reduce process steps such as weld grinding and sealing individual penetrations from screws, nuts and bolts. Many tape and adhesive technologies require little operator training, reducing labor costs.Improve appearance and aesthetics3M adhesive tape is generally hidden between the bonded substrates, offering nearly invisible fastening. Surfaces stay smooth and clean for a more attractive appearance and less surface refinishing.&nbsp;Why Choose SRP For Custom 3M Adhesive Tape Products?SRP has been a Preferred Converter of 3M products for over 25 years.
