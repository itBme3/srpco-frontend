Pressure sensitive adhesives maintain a fine balance between adhesion (holding power of the adhesive on external substrates) and cohesion (holding power of the combined internal components of the adhesive). PSA’s do not require a chemical reaction to develop adhesion forces.Adhesive lamination is one of SRP’s service specialties.
