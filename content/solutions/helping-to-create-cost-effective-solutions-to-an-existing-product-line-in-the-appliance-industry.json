The FRB Series products are made primarily of inorganic materials that are intrinsically flame retardant with good dielectric strength.ResultsNot only did it meet every stringent need for their application, but also it came with a 23% lower cost solution for them without sacri cing performance with the potential for a better end product.Equipment Used: Flatbed Punch Press/Steel Rule Die &nbsp;Materials Used: 3M™ FRB Series NT-15 + 3M™ 467MP Adhesive</p>","media":{"id":217,"name":"TelecomHeatSink.jpg","alternativeText":"TelecomHeatSink","caption":"uploads/2019/10/TelecomHeatSink.jpg","width":1800,"height":1200,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_TelecomHeatSink.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":234,"height":156,"size":11.48,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_TelecomHeatSink.jpg","hash":"large_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":667,"size":94.87,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/large_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_TelecomHeatSink.jpg","hash":"medium_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":500,"size":61.56,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/medium_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_TelecomHeatSink.jpg","hash":"small_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":333,"size":34.6,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc.jpg"}},"hash":"Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":248.92,"url":"/uploads/Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T08:05:18.482Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-13T07:15:20.317Z"},"seo":{"id":3422,"title":"Helping to Create Cost Effective Solutions to an Existing Product Line in the Appliance Industry","description":null,"image":{"id":217,"name":"TelecomHeatSink.jpg","alternativeText":"TelecomHeatSink","caption":"uploads/2019/10/TelecomHeatSink.jpg","width":1800,"height":1200,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_TelecomHeatSink.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":234,"height":156,"size":11.48,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_TelecomHeatSink.jpg","hash":"large_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":667,"size":94.87,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/large_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_TelecomHeatSink.jpg","hash":"medium_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":500,"size":61.56,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/medium_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_TelecomHeatSink.jpg","hash":"small_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":333,"size":34.6,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc.jpg"}},"hash":"Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":248.92,"url":"/uploads/Telecom_Heat_Sink_9a614dc6cc.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T08:05:18.482Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-13T07:15:20.317Z"}},"blocks":[{"id":55,"__component":"solutions.challenge","title":"Challenge","content":"<p>This appliance manufacturing company came to us having already known exactly what they needed from us.
