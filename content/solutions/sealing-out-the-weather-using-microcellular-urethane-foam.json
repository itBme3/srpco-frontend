{"title":"Sealing Out the Weather Using Microcellular Urethane Foam","content":"<p>Customer ChallengeA heating and air conditioning company came to us in search of a more ef cient gasket to seal their units from outside contaminants.Having a product permanantly outdoors makes the construction of the units more dif cult, especially when dealing with different weather conditions throughout the year.This goal was to minimize as much risk as possible, without having to change the design of the HVAC units entry doors.SRP SolutionSRP suggested using a microcellular urethane to create a seal to prevent dust, dirt, and water from entering their heating and air conditioning units.We designed dovetail gaskets to improve material utilization and to also improve the assembly process. This helped lower cost of production for both SRP and our happy customer.ResultsSince the PORON速 microcellular urethane has incredible compression set resistance, the sealing gasket will be able to last through the life of the system without any degredation.Equipment Used: Flash Cutting &nbsp;Materials Used: Rogers PORON速 + Pressure Sensitive
