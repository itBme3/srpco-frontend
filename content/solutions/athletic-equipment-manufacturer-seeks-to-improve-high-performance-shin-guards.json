{"title":"Athletic Equipment Manufacturer Seeks to Improve High-Performance Shin Guards","content":"<p>Customer ChallengeAn athletic equipment manufacturing company was developing an ultra high-performance shin guard for their line of soccer equipment.In order to manufacture the highest performing sports equipment on the market, they started with an aerospace grade 100% Carbon Fiber Composite material for their shin guards.To complete the product, padding needed to be added for comfortability, and to protect the player from getting hurt or injured.SRP SolutionFor the padding, a lightweight, high-performance material was necessary. Our customer selected Rogers PORON® XRD® with Microban® to be adhered to the back of the shin guards.PORON® materials are ideal for applications where compression set resistance is a key product feature. This feature allowed our part to last throughout the lifetime of the product without any degredation.ResultsSRP’s manufacturing expertise enabled us to produce a custom-shaped pad using PORON® XRD® Extreme Impact Protection urethane foam as a cost-effective solution.An additional benefit of using this material over conventional foams is it’s infusion with Microban® Antimicrobial Technology to help prevent the growth of bacteria that causes stains and odors.Equipment Used: Pressure Sensitive Adhesive Laminator | Flash Cutter &nbsp;Materials Used: 2MM THK PORON® XRD® with Microban®
