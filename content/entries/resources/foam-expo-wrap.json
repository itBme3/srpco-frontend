In a world where it seems that trade shows appear to be a fading event for the converting industry, this year the D2P show proved otherwise. Maybe it was the fact that companies were laying low in 2015 as the economy continued to slowly dwindle for the industry, even into the early months of this year. However, it looks as though things are starting to pick back up, at least for SRP.This was by far the most successful show we have attended for our company in years. Of course, the final results cannot be gauged until a few months down the road, so wedon’t want to get too far ahead of ourselves. Talking to many of the other companies exhibiting, it seemed the show was a success for them as well. Whether or not the show was a success for all exhibitors, the interest level of the people attending the show makes it look like things are headed in a positive direction.We spoke with a lot of entrepreneurial start ups looking for prototyping services. The amount of people that are in the design phase of their new projects is very exciting, and isalso another indicator that manufacturing in the converting industry should be back on the up and up soon, so we hope. We would like to thank the D2P team for a successful show on their end, and we look forward to D2P 2017.  We also want to thank Gramovox for supplying their floating record player and Gramaphone Bluetooth speaker for our display. It brought a lot of buzz to booth #349!It is incredible to think how quickly we are approaching the midway point of the year. What is even more incredible is that we are still dealing with mild winter weather in Elk Grove. Our plans as far as trade shows and events go for the rest of the year include the Rwilo Events that aim to elevate art, design, and manufacturing innovation communities. People and businesses collaborate to share ideas, find opportunities, and build solutions. SRP is proud to be a co-sponsor for the event series.

From the time we decided China would be a good fit for SRP, until the day the doors opened was a little over a year. During that year we would come to find solutions to the hardships in which we feared from the beginning. SRP’s owners and managers were determined to make the best of this second location by hiring an Asian business consultant to help us navigate through the complexity of licensing a company in China. We decided against becoming a joint venture, and instead became an LLC. From there we landed on a location in Zhuhai, China.Why Did We Go?The company made the move to provide local support to one of our larger customers who was expanding their manufacturing base in Asia, and wanted localized manufacturing for shorter lead times and rapid engineering support.Choosing Our LocationWe scouted various locations from Beijing and Tianjin to Shanghai and Suzhou to the South Pearl River Delta near Hong Kong and Shenzhen. Our decision was to settle in the city of Zhuhai, located in the South Pearl River Delta because of proximity to the customer, and ease of transporting goods either by air, land, or sea.10 Years LaterNext month marks the 10th Anniversary of the opening of our China facility. Since 2006, we have been able to build a successful manufacturing company through the development of trust through our customers, continuing support using U.S. managers, development of strong relationships with our key suppliers, and a business model that has changed to primarily supporting U.S. companies that have a presence in Asia.In celebration of our 10th Anniversary, the President/CEO of our company, along with the Executive Director of SRP Zhuhai, will be visiting to celebrate a decade of successful business with the entire staff.

Though often overlooked, these gaskets are a key component to the successful function of many products used daily. At Standard Rubber Products Co. (SRP), we have been assisting customers since 1951 by providing custom die cut solutions to help solve various types of thermal application issues.What is a Gasket?Gaskets are specifically designed to serve as a buffer between components. These parts provide several benefits to not only the finished product, but to the end user as well. One of the design features of a gasket is to prevent leakage. The intention is to prevent fluids from leaking out of the component. However, these seals can also prevent outside forces such as dust, dirt, and rain from getting into the application.Specifically designed seals also work to reduce squeaks, rattles or vibrations that are being generated by providing a cushion or pad to absorb that energy. This buffer reduces wear and tear, which in turn works to extend the lifespan and quality of a product.Thermal Gasket FabricationThermal gaskets are specific components which are designed to function in areas that generate high temperatures. They are fabricated in a number of ways. They can be both die and dieless cut from thermal interface materials, gap pads, and filler pads.Advances in technology have enabled expert teams such as ours at SRP to work closely with our customers to design the products they need. With an increase in demand and a streamline of processes, our facilities can enable companies to take their gasket needs from their conceptual origins through mass production.With custom designs to fit specific intended needs, thermal gaskets provide efficient support for both industrial operations and consumer goods. Industries around the world realize that these items are necessary for the prolonged life of various industrial and consumer products.

Of course, this can happen at a very slow rate, creating a challenge to pinpoint the specific cause of the leak or enhanced wear and tear on the component, engine or system.When a thermal gasket fails, there can be significant damage to the rest of the system. As these gaskets are designed to stand up to high heat operating conditions, they are often overlooked as the source of the issue unless they completely breakdown or create a visible leak that can be detected.Here are some common issues that can cause thermal gasket failure. These will vary based on the specific use of the gasket and also the material that the gasket is made from.OverheatingWhile a thermal material is designed to withstand high heat, each has its own range of suitable temperatures for optimal functioning. Exceeding these temperatures, even for short periods of time, will result in early degradation of the gasket material, leading to increased risk of cracking and leaking.Choosing the right type of gasket material that will be able to withstand not just the typical temperatures but the temperature extremes will be critical in preventing failure.PressurePressure creates additional stress on the gasket material, particularly when combined with elevated temperatures. Some of the gasket options are designed specifically for their elasticity, allowing them to stretch and contract with changes in pressure on one or both sides of the gasket.Without this ability, there will be high levels of deformation of the gasket material during operation, another critical cause of failure when operating conditions are not carefully evaluated.Our team will work with you to determine the characteristics necessary for the specific operating conditions. This will help to extend the life of the product and eliminate gasket failure issues.","youtube":null,"blocks":[]},{"id":"30","title":"Silicone Rubber Advances","description":null,"slug":"silicone-rubber-advances","type":"resource","createdAt":"2022-04-15T19:58:07.174Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-16T01:12:45.920Z","publishedAt":"2017-05-22T11:21:03.000Z","collectionType":"resources","tags":[],"pageSettings":null,"seo":{"title":"Silicone Rubber Advances","description":null,"image":{}},"media":{},"content":"Silicone rubber is one of the most versatile materials on the planet.

EMI can result in equipment failure, so it is important to manage it with EMI shields, which can come in the form of conductive gaskets. These shielding products provide electrical conductivity across a gasket-flange interface. EMI gaskets weaken sources of EMI from within devices and provide protection from outside sources as well, thereby ensuring that equipment performs consistently and reliably.At Standard Rubber Products Co. (SRP), we manufacture high quality EMI gaskets using the latest and most sought after materials on the market. We are focused on meeting and anticipating our customers needs by providing them quality EMI shielding products.Knowing Which EMI Gasket to UseWhen choosing which EMI shielding materials to use, it is important to know the radiated emission spectrum of the equipment on which it will be used and the specifications it must meet. EMI gaskets provide different levels of shielding effectiveness across different frequency ranges. Further, EMI gaskets are designed for different environments, such as extreme temperatures, wind and rain, and solvents. If the incorrect gasket for the conditions is used, the performance and lifespan of the gasket can be severely and adversely affected.Another consideration with choosing an EMI gasket is the mechanical requirements. The main goal of an EMI shield is to seal an electronic enclosure in order to prevent electromagnetic interference. Mechanical design must be considered in order to properly pair an EMI gasket with the flanges of an electronic enclosure.EMI Gasket ApplicationsDue to the importance of shielding electromagnetic interference, EMI gaskets have many applications. Essentially, they are used in any situation in which electromagnetic interference may cause performance issues in a piece of equipment. These applications can include:Automotive control systemsAvionicsCommunications systemsComputersHigh-speed electronicsIndoor/Outdoor cellular/mobile base stationsMedical electronicsMilitary electronicsShielded connector sealsAt SRP, our knowledgeable team takes these factors into consideration when working with our customers. We have extensive knowledge of all the available materials, so we are able to work with you in order to design the best EMI shield for your application.","youtube":null,"blocks":[]},{"id":"26","title":"A World without Custom Gaskets","description":null,"slug":"a-world-without-custom-gaskets","type":"resource","createdAt":"2022-04-15T19:58:06.614Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-16T01:12:45.932Z","publishedAt":"2017-10-18T13:59:35.000Z","collectionType":"resources","tags":[],"pageSettings":null,"seo":{"title":"A World without Custom Gaskets","description":null,"image":{}},"media":{},"content":"Gaskets and seals are not glamorous. However, these products protect materials from contaminants and moisture and provide an important cushioning effect. In fact, without custom gasket applications from companies like SRP, the world would be a much different place. Let’s imagine an “alternate reality” where custom-made gaskets do not exist.Make Your Own SealsIn a world of fast-paced production with constant deadlines to meet, many companies won’t have time to cut out and make their own seals. So, to save time and money, they turn to the easiest and fastest ways to seal things.Bonded ProductsBecause there are no special seals or gaskets, many manufacturers will simply bond parts together to prevent fluid leaks and contamination.  On the surface, this doesn’t seem like a bad idea. However, this creates a lot of “throw away” parts and products, because you can no longer take things apart to make repairs.Problems with “Throw Away” ItemsSince very few things are repairable, they end up in scrap heaps and landfills. When you multiply this problem by millions of products on the market today, it won’t take long for the landfills to become overwhelmed. In a world without quality custom gasket products, environmental issues abound.Higher PricesImagine an entire car engine all “glued” together. Maybe engine makers will resort to “gaskets in a tube.” This takes longer than installing a custom gasket, so labor costs soar, and this has an effect on prices like a snowball rolling down a steep hill.Not Much FunWhen you have more ecosystem problems and higher prices, everyone has to work harder for much less.

Many of the materials used to manufacture custom gaskets need to be Mil-Spec certified in order to be used in the industry. Mil-Spec is a strict set of standards used to achieve standardization objectives by the U.S. Department of Defense. Standardization is beneficial in ensuring products meet certain requirements, commonality, reliability, and compatibility.Below is a list of materials used in the defense industry that SRP commonly converts right here in the United States.Mil-Spec Sheet RubberSheet rubber can come in a variety of formulations. Most manufacturers of sheet rubber have a line of Mil-Spec certified rubber for military-grade products made to meet and exceed military specifications. Military-grade sheet rubber can be provided in Neoprene, Nitrile, Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR) and EPDM. These formulations are available in a variety of durometers, tensile strengths and temperature ranges. From applications requiring resistance to oil and solvents, abrasion and flex cracking, ozone and sunlight, heat, water, and steam, to products that require excellent tear strength, vibration damping, temperature specifications, and compression set.Viton® is also available as a Mil-Spec certified grade and offers higher performance than other sheet rubber formulations. Viton® has a broad range of resistance to oils, fuels, lubricants and most mineral acids. It offers very good resistance to many aliphatic hydrocarbon fluids that act as solvents for many other rubbers. It also provides exceptionally good compression set resistance; even at temperatures that can degrade other non-fluorinated elastomers. Viton® has good resistance to atmospheric oxidation, sun, and weather, and excellent resistance to fungus and mold.Polyurethane FoamPORON® offers excellent compression set resistance, which enables durable, long-term sealing performance. Other benefits include low-outgassing and non-fogging, which means the material contains no plasticizers or residual chemicals. The material will not become brittle and crumble and is non-corrosive to metal. PORON® has good chemical resistance, is easy to fabricate, die-cuts cleanly, and works with a broad range of adhesives.Silicone  Silicone materials are known for their performance in high temperature conditions. Silicone is commonly converted into products such as heat shields, gaskets, fire stops, seals, cushions, and insulation for a wide variety of applications including military and defense. Silicone materials are resistant to temperature extremes, UV &amp; ozone, resilient to mechanical fatigue, offer excellent compression set resistance, and meet the most stringent UL flame ratings.Silicone materials are available in both cellular foam, sponge, and solid rubber formulations. The silicone best suited for the defense industry include Saint Gobain NORSEAL® (formerly COHRlastic®), and BISCO® from Rogers Corporation, and are all available with Pressure Sensitive Adhesives.PTFETeflon® PTFE gaskets are used in many industrial applications. They have high performance capabilities including high temperature resistance, surface-wear resistance and resistance to corrosive fluids and is naturally hydrophobic. PTFE has excellent dielectric and thermal insulation properties, with an operating temperature range of -400°F to 500°F. Teflon® PTFE can be fabricated into custom gaskets for defense applications that require the gasket to withstand the life of the product.EMI/RFIElectrical Insulation materials are essential in military components where electricity is present. These materials offer excellent ignitability resistance, arc and track resistance, and good dielectric strength. They can help provide protection to the products and the people using and working with them by providing a barrier to keep electricity contained within the product.Some common insulator materials include: conductive silicones, Kapton® polyimide films, Nomex® Aramid Fibre, Formex®, 3M™ FRB®, Mylar® polyester films, and Lexan® polycarbonates.About SRPSRP has the capabilities to custom fabricate a variety of gaskets and seals for the military and defense industry.

The proper gasket will provide a tight seal in both indoor and outdoor enclosure applications, with the ability to withstand the life of the product.Ensuring the Proper Performance of an Electrical Enclosure GasketOne of the most important aspects of an electrical enclosure gasket is ensuring the gasket passes specific application requirements. Most electrical enclosure applications need to comply with certain types and ratings such as NEMA, UL, and IP (Ingress Protection).To pass such inspections, you need to consider the following questions:Temperature – What temperature range will be required?Location – Will the application be indoor or outdoor?UV Resistance – Will the material be directly exposed?Flame Resistance – Will the material require a certain flame rating?Outgassing – Will material outgassing harm electrical components?Gap Spacing – What is the area needed to be filled by the gasket?Gasket Function – What protection will the gasket need to provide? (air, liquid, vibration?)Material Selection for Custom Electrical Enclosure GasketsIf you are able to provide answers to the above questions, the material selection process will streamline. There are a variety of materials to choose from when it comes to providing the perfect seal in enclosures. Specifically speaking to gasket performance, it’s easy for suppliers to recommend a material that over performs the requirements, resulting in higher spending. It is important to find the most cost-effective solution for each application, while delivering optimum performance.Common materials used for custom electrical enclosure gaskets include the following:Closed Cell Sponge Rubber (Neoprene, EPDM, Nitrile, PVC, SBR)Cellular UrethanePolyethylenePORON® PolyurethaneBISCO® SiliconeAll materials can be supplied adhesive backed with a pressure sensitive adhesive if required.What Are the Risks Associated with An Underperforming Seal? Cost of replacement gaskets and the maintenance associated with replacementPossible loss of UL enclosure ratingCost of damaged electronic components in an enclosureSystematic errors caused by damaged electrical componentsQuality concerns from enclosure manufacturersSRP has been supplying custom electrical enclosure gaskets to the industrial, electronic, HVAC, and telecommunications industries for many years.

Whether the purpose is to form a structural bond, act as a manufacturing aid, or improve the sealing performance of an irregular surface, choosing the best adhesive system for an application is important. PSA’s are the most common adhesive types for gaskets. Typically supplied on the gasket, the assembler then removes a release liner to press-fit the gasket in place.Key considerations when selecting a Pressure Sensitive Adhesive:Adhesion Properties – What is the gasket adhering to? Metal? Plastic?Temperature Capabilities – What temperature range is required?Chemical Compatibility – Will the adhesive be exposed to any chemicals?Dimensional Stability – Do you need to eliminate stretching for assembly?Weather Resistance – Will the adhesive be exposed to outdoor elements?Special Properties – Does the adhesive need to be electrically/thermally conductive, flame retardant?PSA’s typically come in the following formulations:Acrylic Based – Adheres well to most gasketing materials and surfaces while offering a good operating temperature range (-50°F/-46ºC to +350°F/+177ºC intermittent)Silicone Based – Adheres well to silicone elastomers and fair to other surfaces. Silicone adhesives offer the widest operating temperature range, (-80°F/-62ºC to +450°F/+232ºC) but are also the highest cost.Rubber Based – For general use applications, typically lower performance and lower cost.

Thermal Paste","description":null,"image":{}},"media":{},"content":"ADVANTAGES OF THERMAL INTERFACE PADS VS. THERMAL PASTEThermal Interface Materials are a critical aspect in the design of electronic components, making the difference between a working product and a faulty product. The purpose of Thermal Interface Pads is to provide a preferential heat transfer path between heat-generating components like integrated circuit chips (CPUs) and heat spreaders such as a heat sink.If you take a close look at the surface of a CPU or a heat sink, the surface will never be entirely even or level. There will be minuscule bumps, spaces and gaps between the two that will allow for air to pass through the components. Since air is not a good conductor of heat, these gaps have a very negative effect on the heat transfer.Thus, a Thermal Interface Material with high thermal conductivity is needed to fill those gaps to improve heat conductivity between the CPU and heat sink.What are thermal interface materials?Thermal interface materials transfer heat from one surface to another. Ultimately, the goal is to dissipate heat generated from an electrical or mechanical component and into a heat sink, which is usually made of aluminum, copper or even ceramic. The heat sink is deeply ridged, creating air gaps between the ridges, creating an ideal format to dissipate heat.Some thermal interface materials solve a common problem in machinery and electrical components. All too frequently, there are rough, uneven and wavy surfaces, making it difficult to establish the needed surface contact to create sufficient thermal conductivity to get it to flow away from the component. That’s when thermal interface materials serve as gap fillers. It’s specially cut and fitted to create a tight-fitting connection between the two elements, filling the air pockets with thermally conductive material.Thermal interface materials connect the component, allowing the heat to flow from the component and into the heat sink. There are a number of materials and solutions to transfer this heat, but the two most common are thermal interface units and thermal paste.How to apply thermal interface materialsApplying thermal interface padsA thermal interface pad is most often a silicone pad joined to a heat sink. The silicone pad provides thermal conduction that transfers heat from the component to the heat sink. Applying the thermal pad is a simple matter of peeling the adhesive backing on the silicone and sticking to the silicone pad.Applying thermal pasteApplying thermal paste is a matter of applying a thin line of thermal paste on one component, allowing the weight of the heat sink to spread the paste as you join the materials. Thermal paste is made of thermally conductive materials, such as metallic elements, ceramic or silicone.Advantages of Thermal Interface Pads Vs. Thermal PasteNo MessApplying thermal paste can be a messy process. Thermal Pad installation is simply peel and stick.Fills Bigger GapsThermal Pads are available up to .25 inches, as opposed to the thin layer of thermal paste.Even ApplicationThermal paste takes skill and precision to apply evenly and in just the right amount. On one hand, you need enough coverage to conduct the heat. On the other hand, applying too much product would result in messes and waste.Easier InstallationThermal Pads can be custom die-cut to the exact specification of the component for a perfect fit, every time.ConformityThermal Pads conform precisely to uneven and irregular surfaces to eliminate gaps. The silicone layer of the thermal pad becomes softer and more pliable in higher temperatures; by applying light pressure, you can achieve an even snugger fit.Faster AssemblyThermal paste has a curing process, which means there’s a wait for the substance to harden so the assembled item can be moved or handled. The curing that accompanies thermal paste adds time to the assembly and occupies work space.Important Aspects to Consider When Choosing A Thermal Interface MaterialWhen developing electrical components, the design and engineering teams should work closely together to determine key design and functionality factors:The amount of electricity that would be generated from the componentsIdentify any gaps early in the design phase to prevent design changes down the roadDoing this could save a lot of time and money when it comes to prototyping and testing.Application mistakes with Thermal Interface MaterialsWhen using Thermal Interface Materials, steer clear of these common application errors.Never combine Thermal Pads and Thermal Pastes. Thermal Paste will reduce the thermal conductivity to pass through the Thermal Pad to reach the heat sink.Avoid stacking Thermal Pads. This will decrease the material’s performance. One Thermal Pad with the correct thickness and thermal conductivity rating is all that is required to solve even the most stringent application issues.If you ever remove a heat sink, the Thermal Pad will need to be replaced to properly conform to the surface. Be sure to remove any debris that may have entered the component as well.SRP: BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH CONVERTING SOLUTIONS SINCE 1951SRP provides customers with everything from material sampling and product prototyping to full manufacturing, packaging and delivery.

Whether the goal is to make a tight protective seal or silence annoying vibrations, these flexible synthetic rubber gasket materials can be safely used in many industrial and consumer applications.These materials sometimes get confused for one another, but the choice often comes down to price and properties. EPDM provides an excellent electrical insulator, while Neoprene is more chemical resistant and makes a good thermal insulator.Neoprene is an elastomer that is also called chloroprene, and is made of a combination of carbon, hydrogen and chlorine polymers. EPDM is an acronym for Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer, a synthetic rubber that’s derived from polyethylene.In the following, we’ll unpack the similarities and differences between Neoprene and EPDM to get you started on choosing the best material to make a strong, safe seal.How are Neoprene and EPDM similar?Excellent outdoor applicationNeoprene and EPDM both withstand outdoor conditions extremely well, withstanding ozone and ultra-violet rays. They also maintain their flexibility, even in extremely cold outdoor temperatures, down to -70 degrees Fahrenheit. They can also weather extremely hot days, enduring for years even in the harshest climates.Noise and vibration resistanceEPDM and Neoprene both provide excellent noise resistance, dampening the force of sound and vibrations for the end user.Tough and ruggedBoth Neoprene and EPDM rubber are rugged elastomers, with excellent resistance to rips and abrasions.Tolerate compressionNeoprene and EPDM are rated as having a good pressure set, giving them the ability to maintain their fabricated form, even after compression and elongation.What are the top advantages of EPDM over Neoprene?Blocks electrical interferenceThe chemical properties of EPDM make it an excellent electrical insulator as it blocks electrical interference from entering a component, protecting the products as well as the people using them.[For a deeper dive read Identifying the proper electrical enclosure gasket]Resists water and steamThough Neoprene is water resistant, EPDM is considered the most water resistant of the elastomers, as it doesn’t swell or react to water. EPDM maintains a tight, safe seal, without leaching chemicals.Withstands higher temperaturesEPDM withstands temperatures as high as 220 degrees F for sponge rubber, up to 250+ degrees for sheet rubber.Less expensiveFrom a price point, EPDM is usually the less expensive material compared to Neoprene.EPDM is resistant to:Diluted acidsDiluted alkalisPhosphatesPolar solventsKetonesFireproof hydraulic acidsEPDM is not compatible with:Oils, greases and fats (otherwise it becomes swollen)Concentrated acidHalogenated solventsHydrocarbon fuelsAromatic hydrocarbons[Looking for the right adhesive?

Gasket tape is foam with adhesive backing that comes in a roll that can be cut to size to seal out liquids and gases. Compared to using liquid and spray adhesive, gasket tape provides a peel-and-stick solution that simplifies production without sacrificing on quality.Unlike rivets and fasteners, gasket tapes make your design less bulky, while also dampening noise and vibration.Though glues and spray adhesive provide excellent bonding strength with rubber and silicone gasket material, pressure-sensitive tape requires no drying and curing time. Gasket tape reaches handling strength right after it’s applied to the surface, making production more efficient.Gasket tape contributes to a cleaner and safer production environment, with no fumes or special equipment handling.To bring your product to life with gasket tape, work with an experienced converting partner who can die-cut your gasket tape — or custom make a peel-and-stick gasket that meets your design requirements.The key to choosing the right gasket tape is finding the right tape structure and adhesive. The best tapes used for gasketing are: very high bonding tape, adhesive transfer tape and double-sided tape. Use this overview to help you narrow your selection so you can finalize your design.Very high bonding tapeVery high bonding tape is the go-to gasket foam tape. Its bond builds strength over time, while the adhesive and the closed cell foam core maintains its performance when exposed to high temperatures and solvents.Because of its high-strength acrylic adhesive, very high bonding tape can take the place of rivets and screws, making your product design smoother, more streamlined and lighter — not to mention you can eliminate the rattle and vibrations that accompany loosening screws and rivets.Along with taking the place of foam or rubber gaskets, this high bonding foam gasket tape can join two dissimilar surfaces, such as: aluminum, steel, glass, plastic as well as painted and powder-coated surfaces.Adhesive transfer tape and double-sided tapeThough foam gasket tape comes in many widths, thicknesses and material, sometimes it’s better to create a custom gasket tape. Adhesive transfer tape and double-sided tape can be applied directly to sheets of rubber, foam rubber or silicone. Then, through a custom slitting process, the materials are converted into a foam gasket tape.The material can then be cut to size and die or laser cut to your specific dimensions. When you’re ready to fasten your custom gasket tape to your product, simply peel the backing, and it will instantly adhere to your chosen surface.How do you choose the best tape for a rubber gasket?That depends, because the adhesive transfer tape and double-sided tape are available in different chemistries and bonding strengths. This quick overview shows how they compare.Rubber gasket tape is cost-effective, adhering to synthetic and natural rubber material more quickly than silicone and acrylic adhesive tapes can. However, the biggest downside is the adhesive in rubber tapes deteriorates after prolonged exposure to sunlight.Acrylic gasket tape forms a strong, lasting bond to rubber materials, even when exposed to harsh environments.Silicone gasket tape provides strengths and resistance to harsh conditions, but is most effective when bonded with silicone gasket materials.SRP is proud to be part of the 3M Preferred Converter network.

When it comes to gasket design, a complete set of details helps us come up with the best possible plan to hit your deadlines and stay on budget. When preparing your gasket consultation, use this checklist as a guide.1. Do you have a CAD drawing?This may seem like an elementary question to most customers. However, those who are new to gasket design may not be familiar with the details we require.Converting your gasket design to a CAD provides us with the best representation of the gasket’s visuals and dimensions. This information lets us identify the material cutting method that best fits your requirements, including tolerance range, deadlines and budget, so we can give you a fast and accurate quote.2. What is the gasket’s acceptable tolerance range?Many customers don’t think to factor this in. But during the design and planning stage, you’ll want to account for the small variations in dimensions that occur in a material when it’s cut by a specific method. These variations (tolerances) are often imperceptible to the naked eye.Most gaskets function flawlessly within the standard tolerance range. But if your gasket requires a tighter-than-standard tolerance to hold everything together, we’ll need to look at higher-precision cutting methods.Providing this data early lets us choose the cutting method that’s best for your gasket.3. What does your gasket do?Successful gasket design considers the material’s ability to protect and hold in the conditions the product would be exposed to. In most cases, there would be a specific set of specifications to follow, which consider things like:Temperature: What temperature range would the material be exposed to?Location: Is this an indoor or outdoor application?Resistance to UV rays, chemicals and solvents: What would the material be exposed to, and how much and how often?Flame resistance: Would the material require a particular flame rating?Gasket function: What will the gasket be sealing or protecting?The more we know about the project, the better we can assist you in the design and manufacturing processes.4. Any quality requirements for your gasket’s project approval?As we plan your project, it helps to know your firm’s review process after the order is filled. If you know of any out-of-the-ordinary parameters, indicating it upfront can save us both time and money. Some companies require specific quality samples and prototypes, backed with datasheets and inspection reports. (A common one is the First Article Inspection Report.) It’s equally common for companies to not require this level of review.5. Does your project require a prototype?This ties into the above quality review question. If you need a prototype, let us know of any requirements that will be a part of that review.6. What is your lead time?At SRP, we build custom gaskets to order. We keep materials in stock, but we don’t maintain a warehouse of finished products. We typically quote 4-6 weeks for orders, though we’re usually ready to ship them out in 3-4 weeks. If your project has a tight deadline, keep in mind that material availability and other factors can come into play.7. What are your packaging requirements?Packaging requirements can run the gamut in the gasket business. It’s an often-overlooked question that can affect the gasket delivery, especially if you’re looking for something unusual. Will you need a barcode for inventory management purposes?

In the making of custom-made gaskets, adhesive transfer tape is the fastener of choice, especially once you compare this option to more traditional fasteners:Mechanical fastenersBolts, rivets and screws are the mechanical go-to because of the strength but also for the fact they create a bond you can see and feel. On the downside, mechanical fasteners add weight and bulk to your design. During assembly, they create an extra step of labor that requires equipment and a special skill set. Plus, over the life of the product, metal parts can loosen, causing annoying rattling and vibrations during use.Liquid and hot melt adhesivesLiquid and hot melt adhesives are an effective means to create a strong, lasting bond between two unlike substrates, whether it’s metal to plastic or acrylic to silicone. However, this option requires specialized equipment in-house. Also, drying and curing add time to the production schedule.WeldingThis option provides all the strength of a mechanical fastener, but the result is that slim profile that we like to see. However, welding requires skilled labor, and can’t create bonds of equal strength when joining two dissimilar surfaces.Why use adhesive transfer tape in gasket bonding?Adhesive transfer tape provides the solution to all the above problems. When adhesive transfer tape is layered on the gasket material and cut to the specified dimensions, it creates the ultimate peel-and-stick solution to your gasketing needs.Other advantages of using adhesive transfer tape as a gasket fastener:Streamlines productionAdhesive transfer tape bonds immediately and builds strength over time. But it requires no drying, no curing, and the item can be handled right after application. Unlike liquid and hot melt adhesive, production can move to the next step.Low profileAdhesive transfer tape is super thin and lightweight, adding no bulk to your design.FlexibilityUneven surfaces can be bonded together without the worry of the adhesive losing its grip.StrengthStress and pressure are evenly distributed across the gasket surface to provide the best performance.VersatilityAdhesive transfer tape has no carrier. It’s adhesive placed on a silicone liner that peels away easily when you need it.Adhesive transfer tape: The ideal converter materialAdhesive transfer tape provides a blank canvas for a variety of projects and products. Because its applications are almost unlimited, adhesive transfer tape is the ultimate converter material. Compared to other fasteners, it’s a simple and inexpensive method to join two surfaces.Adhesive transfer tape is simply a strip of adhesive placed on a liner. When used as a gasket fastener, it’s applied to the gasket material before it’s cut.During the production of the converter, the liner stays put. Not only does this liner provide a backing material for your peel-and-stick gasket, but during cutting, the liner is an effective means of keeping the adhesive in place. Because the liner minimizes any stretching and moving, this converter method provides complete adhesive coverage. This creates an effective fastener. This also enhances any sealing function you require of the gasket — an important consideration if you’re using solvent- and water-resistant substrates, such as silicone or Neoprene.SRP is proud to be part of the 3M Preferred Converter network.

When it comes to choosing between pressure-sensitive tape vs liquid adhesive, it comes down to the application, and how the adhesive needs to perform under the conditions.What will the gasket be exposed to? You’ll be considering factors like temperature, solvents and climate conditions. Which industry standards would the product need to comply with? Once you’ve completed a likely use analysis on the product, you can get started on choosing an adhesive.Pros and cons of spray and liquid adhesivesSpray adhesives are the go-to for many industries and applications because they provide a strong, lasting bond for an attractive materials cost. Other advantages:Fast application, by spray, roll or brush for immediate assembly.Great coverage, especially if you’re applying it to an irregularly shaped surface.But when you consider other factors of using liquid adhesives, this route can end up raising your production and materials costs.Liquid adhesives can be applied manually or by machine, meaning they come with operational and equipment costs.Liquid adhesives need time for curing and drying, which means it can be minutes or even more than an hour before the item reaches full handling strength.Liquid adhesives can add an extra step of cleanup, thanks to drips and spills.Liquid adhesives can leave odors and fumes in a work space, which requires additional venting to ensure a safe and pleasant work environment.When applied properly, liquid adhesives can provide a strong, lasting bond. However, they don’t always apply evenly, disrupting the bond and the performance of your product.Why use pressure-sensitive tape in gasketing?The big advantage of using pressure-sensitive tape for a gasket over liquid adhesive is efficiency. Pressure-sensitive tape saves time on the production floor while minimizing costs.A converter partner applies the pressure-sensitive tape directly to the surface of the gasket material before cutting the custom shape. Once you’re ready to apply the gasket to the substrate, simply peel the protective backing and place it on the surface, while applying pressure for a brief time.It’s versatile because an adhesive-backed gasket can be done manually or through automation.Curing time is also a key advantage. While the adhesives need time to gain full bonding strength, most PSAs reach handling strength immediately after handling.Consistency of coverage makes PSAs an attractive option. In the converting process, you’ll know the gasket has full, even coverage of adhesive. It eliminates the risks from gaps and bubbles.Appearance: In addition to leaving no drips, pressure-sensitive tape create a seamless bond between the gasket and material. If you’re looking to update your design, making your product lighter and more streamlined and attractive, PSAs can provide a solution across many industries.To learn more, read The upside of using adhesive transfer tape in gasket bonding.Working with a converter partner to create a custom cut, adhesive-backed gasket can improve your production processes. Bottom line, PSAs are more versatile, faster curing and they improve the appearance of your design. But are PSAs strong enough to do the job? PSAs are used across many industries, including demanding ones such as aerospace, automotive and industrial, so there’s a wide availability of highly engineered adhesives that come in PSA form that stand up to the toughest conditions.For a deeper dive, read A quick guide to gasket adhesive tapes.As you make the selection, working with a converter partner can help you select the best tape for your gasket that can achieve the protection and performance you’re looking for.SRP is proud to be part of the 3M Preferred Converter network.
