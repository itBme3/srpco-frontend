HandlingApplication Information Application Examples  Dissimilar materials joining, such as metal to plastic    High performance joining and bonding Family Group Table continued on next page 3M Double Coated Tape 9500PC HandlingApplication Information continued Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and improves   bond strength   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unied Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory   Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives 70070414308   For additional dispenser information, contact your local 3M sales
