Family Group Table continued on next page 3M™ Double Coated Tape 9500PC Handling/Application Information (continued) Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and improves   bond strength.   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well uni\u0000ed. Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane.*   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory.   *Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when working with solvents. Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality. To learn more about working with pressure-sensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives (70-0704-1430-8).
