Available Sizes Available Lengths (Subject to Minimum order requirements) Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and improves bond strength. To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unified. Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane. Note: Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when working with solvents. These cleaning recommendations may not be in compliance with the rules of certain Air Quality Management Districts in California; consult applicable rules before use. IMPORTANT: For optimum liner clarity on 3M™ Double Coated Polyester Tape 442F and 442DL products, it is recommended the tape product be processed from supplied roll format into converted product with-in six months of the manufacturing date. After six months the liner clarity may be reduced due to a haze effect. This liner clarity does not impact adhesive or liner performance over the shelf life of the product. Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too firm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory. Features •  Polycoated paper liners and the polyester liners offer moisture stability  •  3M™ Double Coated Polyester Tapes 442F and 442DL (double linered) also offer an extended shelf life of an additional six months. •  Polyester film carrier at its center core which enhances the workability when laminating to various types of surfaces. •  Film also enhances the die cutability of the finished product. •  Provides clean removability from many surfaces. Application Ideas These tapes are ideal for bonding together a wide variety of similar and dissimilar materials such as rubbers, metals, glass, papers, paints and many plastics. Some application ideas include: – Splicing of films, foils, papers, fabrics. – Holding objects where high shear forces are encountered. – Holding grinding and polishing pads. – Miscellaneous joining and holding uses. - 3 - Application Equipment Wide web lamination To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality. To learn more about working with pressure-sensitive adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives (70-0704-1430-8).
