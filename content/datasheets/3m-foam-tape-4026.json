Product Features • The natural colored urethane foam tape products vary in color from white to light yellow. The color will   change to light yellow upon exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet radiation). This color change is normal and does   not a\u0000ect tape performance.   • 3M™Double Coated Urethane Foam Tape 4026 is available in roll form and diecut pieces. Die-cut pieces of   3M tape 4026 is available in 3/4\" or 1\" squares, either individual pieces double linered with an extended liner   on one side or in pads of 48 squares. 3M™ Double Coated Urethane Foam Tape 4026 Technical Information Note The following technical information and data should be considered representative or typical only and should not be used for speci\u0000cation purposes.

The urethane   foam is open cell.   3M™ Double Coated Urethane Foam Tape 4026 – Mount air fresheners and soap dispensers Application Techniques • Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and   improve bond strength.   • To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well uni\u0000ed. Typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol* and water (rubbing   alcohol) or heptane.   • Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory.   *Note: Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when using solvents. Storage and Shelf Life Store in original cartons at 70°F (21°C) and 50% relative humidity.   To obtain best performance, use these products within 24 months from date of manufacture.
