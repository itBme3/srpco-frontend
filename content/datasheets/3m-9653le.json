Bond Build-up: The bond strength of 3M™ Adhesive 300LSE increased as a function of time and temperature, and has very high initial adhesion.   Humidity Resistance: High humidity has a minimal e\u0000ect on adhesive performance. No signi\u0000cant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for 7 days at   90°F (32°C) and 90% relative humidity.   U.V. Resistance: When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely a\u0000ected by exposure.   Water Resistance: Immersion in water has no appreciable e\u0000ect on the bond strength. After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained.   Temperature Cycling Resistance: High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through:             4 hours at 158°F (70°C)             4 hours at -20°F (-29°C)             4 hours at 73°F (22°C)   Chemical Resistance: When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids   and alkalis.   Temperature Resistance: 3M™ Adhesive 300LSE is usable for short periods (minutes, hours) at temperatures up to 300°F (148°C) and for intermittent longer periods   of time (days, weeks) up to 200°F (93°C).   Lower Service Temperature: -40°F (-40°C). Processing Slitting and die-cutting: This adhesive is very aggressive and may be di\u0000cult to convert depending on your application requirements. Chilling the adhesive between   35°F and 50°F will improve the processability. In addition, dies can be lubricated with evaporative stamping oil. You may also refer to our Technical Bulletin on 3M™   Adhesive 300LSE converting. (70-0707-6205-2)   Roll Laminating: A combination of metal and rubber rollers with moderate pressure is recommended. Note: Please refer to the Technical Bulletin on slitting. (70-0709- 3905-6) Handling/Application Information Application Examples • Plastic nameplates or graphic overlays for use on low surface energy plastics.   • Waste removed nameplates on a common sheet for ease of application.   • Attaching membrane switch assemblies to powder coated surfaces and low surface energy plastics.   • Graphic overlays with end tabs for easy liner removal.   • Graphic application to surfaces such as wood, fabric, plastic, where very high bond strength is required.   • Attaching identi\u0000cation material to lightly oily surfaces typical of machine parts. Family Group 3M™ Adhesive Transfer Tape 9653LE Handling/Application Information (continued) Application Techniques For maximum bond strength, the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried. Typical cleaning solvents are methyl ethyl ketone for metals or isopropyl alcohol for   plastics. Carefully read and follow manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when using cleaning solvents.   Bond strength can also be improved with \u0000rm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100°F (38°C) to 130°F (54°C), causing the adhesive to develop intimate   contact with the bonding surface.   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended   for most pressure-sensitive adhesives because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory. Storage and Shelf Life Store at room temperature conditions of 70°F (21°C) and 50% relative humidity.   If stored properly, product retains its performance and properties for 24 months from date of manufacture. Trademarks 3M is a trademark of 3M Company.
