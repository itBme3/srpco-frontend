The acrylic adhesive also provides excellent adhesion to surfaces contaminated lightly with oil typically used with machine parts. 3M double coated tape 9490LE offers the added feature of  3M™ Laminating Adhesive 300MP on  one side to provide excellent bond strength to a variety of foam and fabric materials. 3 Technical Data November 2011 Construction Faceside 1 Carrier Backside 2 Liner Total Tape Product Adhesive Type/ Adhesive Color, Type, Liner Thickness Number Thickness Thickness Thickness Print Caliper (w/o liner) 3M™ Double  2.8 mil Clear PET 3 3.4 mil Tan, 58#, 4.2 mil 6.7 mil Coated Tape (0.071mm) 0.5 mil (0.086mm) Polycoated Kraft (0.11mm) (0.17mm) 9490LE 4 (0.013mm) “3M 300LSE” Note 1:   Faceside (FS) adhesive 300MP is on the interior of the roll, exposed when unwound. Note 2:   Backside (BS) adhesive 300LSE is on the exterior of the roll, exposed when liner is removed. Note 3:   PET (Polyester). Note 4:   The caliper listed is based on a calculation from manufacturing controlled adhesive coat weights using a density of 1.01 2 g/cc. Features •  This tape has a moisture resistant polycoated kraft liner which can withstand high humidity conditions with minimal cockling or wrinkling. •  This tape has a film carrier which can add dimensional stability to foams and other substrates and also make it easier to handle the tape during slitting and die-cutting. •  The bond strength of 3M™ Laminating Adhesive 300LSE increases as a function of time and temperature, and has very high initial adhesion. Application Ideas •  Foam attachment for electronic assemblies. •  Low surface energy substrates. •  Graphic attachment of high surface energy and low surface energy. 3M ™ Double Coated Tape 9490LE Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics Note:  The following technical information and data should be considered representative or typical only and should not be used for specification purposes.

No significant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for seven days at 90°F (32°C) and 90% relative humidity. UV Resistance: When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely affected by exposure to direct sunlight. Water Resistance: Immersion in water has no appreciable effect on the bond strength. After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained. Temperature Cycling Resistance: High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through: 4 hours at 158°F (70°C) 4 hours at -20°F (-29°C) 4 hours at 73°F (22°C) Chemical Resistance: When properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids and alkalis. Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100°F (38°C) to 130°F (54°C), will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface. To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unified. Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane. * Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too firm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory. *Note: Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when working with solvents. These cleaning recommendations may not be compliant with the rules of certain Air Quality Management Districts in California; consult applicable rules before use. Storage Store in original cartons at 70°F (21°C) and 50% relative humidity. Shelf Life If stored under proper conditions, product retains its performance and properties for two years from date of manufacture.
