9490LE with 3M Laminating Adhesive 300LSE provides high bond strength to most surfaces, including many low surface energy plastics such as polypropylene and powder coated paints The acrylic adhesive also provides excellent adhesion to surfaces contaminated lightly with oil typically used with machine parts 3M double coated tape 9490LE offers the added feature of  3M Laminating Adhesive 300MP on  one side to provide excellent bond strength to a variety of foam and fabric materials 3 Technical Data November 2011 Construction Faceside 1 Carrier Backside 2 Liner Total Tape Product Adhesive Type

Features   This tape has a moisture resistant polycoated kraft liner which can withstand high humidity conditions with minimal cockling or wrinkling   This tape has a film carrier which can add dimensional stability to foams and other substrates and also make it easier to handle the tape during slitting and diecutting   The bond strength of 3M Laminating Adhesive 300LSE increases as a function of time and temperature, and has very high initial adhesion Application Ideas   Foam attachment for electronic assemblies   Low surface energy substrates   Graphic attachment of high surface energy and low surface energy 3M  Double Coated Tape 9490LE Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics Note  The following technical information and data should be considered

adhesive performance No significant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for seven days at 90F 32C and 90 relative humidity UV Resistance When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely affected by exposure to direct sunlight Water Resistance Immersion in water has no appreciable effect on the bond strength After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained Temperature Cycling Resistance High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through 4 hours at 158F 70C 4 hours at 20F 29C 4 hours at 73F 22C Chemical Resistance When properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids and alkalis Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100F 38C to 130F 54C, will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unified Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane  Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too firm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory Note Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents These cleaning recommendations may not be compliant with the rules of certain Air Quality Management Districts in California consult applicable rules before use Storage Store in original cartons at 70F 21C and 50 relative humidity Shelf Life If stored under proper conditions, product retains its performance and properties for two years from date of manufacture 4 3M  Double Coated Tape 9490LE
