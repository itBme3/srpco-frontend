Performance features include superior adhesion to Polypropylene, great resistance to consumer chemicals   and excellent holding power. 3M type 300LSE acrylic adhesive has a long history of successfully bonding a   wide variety of similar and dissimilar materials such as metals, most plastics, glass, papers, and painted   surfaces. Product Features • This tape has a \u0000lm carrier which can add dimensional stability to foams and other substrates and also makes   it easier to handle the tape during slitting and die-cutting.   • The bond strength of 3M™ Laminating Adhesive 300LSE increases as a function of time and temperature,   and has very high initial adhesion. 3M™ Double Coated Tape 9495LE Technical Information Note The following technical information and data should be considered representative or typical only and should not be used for speci\u0000cation purposes.

No signi\u0000cant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for 72hrs at   150°F (65°C) and 90% relative humidity.   UV Resistance: When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely a\u0000ected by exposure to direct sunlight.   Water Resistance: Immersion in water has no appreciable e\u0000ect on the bond strength. After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained.   Temperature Cycling Resistance: High bond strength is maintained after cycling six times through:                       8 hours at -4°F (-20°C)                       8 hours at 150°F (65°C) /90% RH   Chemical Resistance: When properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids and   alkalis. Family Group Table continued on next page 3M™ Double Coated Tape 9495LE Handling/Application Information Application Examples • Foam to powder coated painted surfaces.   • Low surface energy plastic adhesion.   • Lens bonding applications Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100°F (38°C) to 130°F   (54°C), will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface.   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well uni\u0000ed. Typical cleaning solvents are methyl ethyl ketone for metals or isopropyl   alcohol for plastics. Carefully read and follow manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when using cleaning solvents.   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory. Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality. To learn more about working with pressure-sensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives (70-0704-1430-8).
