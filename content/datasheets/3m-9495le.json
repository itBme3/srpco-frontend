Product Description Finite Element Analysis FEA  data is available for this product at  3mcomFEA 3M 9495LE is a 170m Double Coated Polyester Tape featuring 3M Type 300LSE Acrylic Adhesive   Performance features include superior adhesion to Polypropylene, great resistance to consumer chemicals   and excellent holding power 3M type 300LSE acrylic adhesive has a long history of successfully bonding a   wide variety of similar and dissimilar materials such as metals, most plastics, glass, papers, and painted   surfaces Product Features  This tape has a lm carrier which can add dimensional stability to foams and other substrates and also makes   it easier to handle the tape during slitting and diecutting    The bond strength of 3M Laminating Adhesive 300LSE increases as a function of time and temperature,   and has very high initial adhesion 3M Double Coated Tape 9495LE Technical Information Note The following technical information and data should be considered representative or

chemicals including oil, mild acids and   alkalis Family Group Table continued on next page 3M Double Coated Tape 9495LE HandlingApplication Information Application Examples  Foam to powder coated painted surfaces    Low surface energy plastic adhesion    Lens bonding applications Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100F 38C to 130F   54C, will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unied Typical cleaning solvents are methyl ethyl ketone for metals or isopropyl   alcohol for plastics Carefully read and follow manufacturers precautions and directions for use when using cleaning solvents   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of
