Resistance  High humidity has a minimal eect on adhesive performance Bond strength shows no signicant reduction after exposure for 7 days at 90F   32C and 90 relative humidity   UV Resistance  When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely aected by outdoor exposure   Water Resistance  Immersion in water has no appreciable eect on the bond strength After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained   Temperature Cycling Resistance  High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through             4 hours at 158F 70C             4 hours at 20F 29C             4 hours at 73F 22C   Chemical Resistance  When properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids   and alkalis   Bond Buildup The bond strength of 3M High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP increases as a function of time and temperature   TemperatureHeat Resistance 3M High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP is usable for short periods minutes, hours at temperatures up to400F 204C and   for intermittent longer periods days, weeks up to 300F 149C   Lower Temperature Service Limit The glass transition temperature for 3M High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP is 31F 35C Many applications survive   below this temperature factors aecting successful applications include materials being bonded, dwell at RT before cold exposure, and stress below the TG ie   expansioncontraction stresses, impact Optimum conditions are bonding high surface energy materials, longer time at RT before cold exposure, and little or no   stress below the TG The lowest service temperature is 40F 40C 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape 468MP HandlingApplication Information Application Examples  Long term bonding of graphic nameplates and overlays subsurface printed polycarbonate or polyester to metal and high surface energy plastics in the aerospace,   medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets    Bonding metal nameplates and rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets    Bonding graphic overlays for membrane switches and for bonding the complete switch to the equipment surface    High speed processing of parts in the medical, telecommunications and electronics markets medical components, durable labels, and exible circuits    Lamination to industrial foams for rotary diecutting of small gaskets for industrial and electronics markets Application Techniques For maximum bond strength during installation of the nal part the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried Typical cleaning solvents are heptane for oily   surfaces or isopropyl alcohol for plastics Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the   drying aect on skin and can interfere with the performance of a pressuresensitive adhesive   Note Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents These cleaning recommendations may not be in   compliance with the rules of certain air quality management districts in California consult applicable rules before use   It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination 1520 pli recommended and during nal part installation 1015 psi to allow the adhesive to come into direct   contact with the substrate Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of   lamination Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks For   plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat   The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 60F 156C to 100F 38C Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50F 10C   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory please refer to section VII of the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics   When bonding a thin, smooth, exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of 3M Adhesive 200MP If a texture is visible on one or   both surfaces, the 5 mil 3M adhesive 200MP would be suggested If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the   components 3M VHB Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required please refer to the data page 70070938306   To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives 70070414308 For additional dispenser information,   contact your local 3M sales representative, or the toll free 3M sales assistance number at 18003623550 Storage and Shelf Life It is
