Available Lengths (Subject to minimum order requirements) (3) 3M ™ Double Coated Tapes with 9492MP •  9495MP •  9495MPF •  9495B Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100°F (38°C) to 130°F (54°C), will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface. To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unified. Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane. * Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too firm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory. *Note: Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when working with solvents. These cleaning recommendations may not be compliant with the rules of certain Air Quality Management Districts in California; consult applicable rules before use. Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality. To learn more about working with pressure-sensitive adhesives please refer to technical bulletin,  Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives (70-0704-1430-8).

Adding Liners to 3M ™ Double Coated Tapes with 3M ™ Laminating Adhesive 200MP 1.  Rotary processing, tape only, on a densified (outside of #4994) kraft liner. In this process the tape waste will stay with the 58# PCK liner, leaving adhesive die-cuts dispensable from the #4994 (densified kraft) liner. 2.  Rotary processing for finished parts. It is most efficient to use the polyester linered double coat (3M™ Double Coated Tape 9495MPF). Current process limitations prevent the supply of the 3M™ Laminating Adhesive 200MP on a DK liner. Environmental Performance Humidity Resistance: High humidity has minimal effect on adhesive performance. No significant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for seven days at 90°F (32°C) and 90% relative humidity. UV Resistance: When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely affected by exposure to direct sunlight. Water Resistance: Immersion in water has no appreciable effect on the bond strength. After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained. Temperature Cycling Resistance: High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through: 4 hours at 158°F (70°C) 4 hours at -20°F (-29°C) 4 hours at 73°F (22°C) Chemical Resistance: When properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids and alkalis.
