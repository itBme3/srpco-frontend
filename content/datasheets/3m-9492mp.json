developed Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100F 38C to 130F 54C, will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unified Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane  Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too firm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory Note Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents These cleaning recommendations may not be compliant with the rules of certain Air Quality Management Districts in California consult applicable rules before use Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive adhesives please refer to technical bulletin,  Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives 70070414308 For

Adhesive 200MP 1  Rotary processing, tape only, on a densified outside of 4994 kraft liner In this process the tape waste will stay with the 58 PCK liner, leaving adhesive diecuts dispensable from the 4994 densified kraft liner 2  Rotary processing for finished parts It is most efficient to use the polyester linered double coat 3M Double Coated Tape 9495MPF Current process limitations prevent the supply of the 3M Laminating Adhesive 200MP on a DK liner Environmental Performance Humidity Resistance High humidity has minimal effect on adhesive performance No significant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for seven days at 90F 32C and 90 relative humidity UV Resistance When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely affected by exposure to direct sunlight Water Resistance Immersion in water has no appreciable effect on the bond strength After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained Temperature Cycling Resistance High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through 4 hours at 158F 70C 4 hours at 20F 29C 4 hours at 73F 22C Chemical Resistance When properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids and alkalis 4 3M  Double Coated Tapes with 9492MP   9495MP   9495MPF   9495B Storage Store in
