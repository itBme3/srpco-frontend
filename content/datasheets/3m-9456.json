Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and improves   bond strength.   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well uni\u0000ed. Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane.   Note: Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when working with solvents.   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory. Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality. To learn more about working with pressure-sensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives (70-0704-1430-8).

Storage and Shelf Life It is best to use the rolls as soon as possible after receipt. Ideally, rolls should be laminated to the intended substrates as soon after receipt as possible. Store in original   cartons at 70°F (21°C) and 50% relative humidity. When storing rolls, lay them \u0000at in a horizontal position with release treated wafers between the rolls.   If stored under proper conditions, product retains its performance and properties for 24 months from date of manufacture. Trademarks 3M is a trademark of 3M Company.
