HandlingApplication Information Application Examples  End Tabbing    Bonding fabric to rigid cardboard    Attaching foam to plastics    Closing CD chipboard mailers Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and improves   bond strength   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unied Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane   Note Carefully read and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when working with solvents   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives 70070414308   For additional dispenser information, contact your local 3M sales representative, or the toll free 3M sales assistance number at 18003623550 Storage and Shelf Life It is best to use the rolls as soon as possible after receipt Ideally, rolls should be laminated to the intended substrates as soon after receipt as possible Store in original   cartons at 70F 21C and 50 relative humidity When storing rolls, lay them at in a horizontal position with release treated wafers between the rolls   If stored under proper conditions, product retains its performance and properties for 24 months from date of manufacture Trademarks 3M is a trademark of 3M Company References Table continued on next page Property Values 3mcom Product Page
