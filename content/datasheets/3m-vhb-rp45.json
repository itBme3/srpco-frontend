The multi-purpose acrylic adhesive on both sides bonds to a broad range of high and medium surface energy   substrates including metals, glass and a wide variety of paints and plastics. The conformable foam provides   good contact between substrates even when they are slightly mismatched. 3M™ VHB™ Tape RP45 is part of   the RP tape family. Each product in this family has multi-purpose acrylic adhesive and conformable foam but   varies in thickness and liner type.

Adhesives must \u0000ow onto the substrate surfaces in order to achieve intimate contact area and   allow the molecular force of attraction to develop. The degree of \u0000ow of the adhesive on the substrate is largely determined by the surface energy of the substrate.   3M™ VHB™ RP family tapes bond well to high (HSE) and medium (MSE) surface energy materials.  The image below shows typical materials in these categories.   Achieving good contact is also important.  The necessary thickness of tape depends on the rigidity of substrates and their \u0000atness irregularity. While the 3M™ VHB™   Tapes will conform to a certain amount of irregularity, they will not \u0000ow to \u0000ll gaps between the materials. For bonding rigid materials with normal \u0000atness, consider   use of tapes with thickness of 45 mils (1.1 mm) or greater. As the substrate \u0000exibility increases thinner tapes can be considered.   Using the right amount of tape is important to handle the expected stresses.  Because 3M™ VHB™ Tapes are viscoelastic by nature their strength and sti\u0000ness is a   function of the rate at which they are stressed. They behave stronger with relatively faster rate of stress load (dynamic stresses) and will tend to show creep behavior   with stress load acting over a long period of time (static stresses). As a general rule, for static loads, approximately four square inches of tape should be used for each   pound (57 cm² of tape per kg) of weight to be supported in order to prevent excessive creep. For dynamic loads a useful design factor is 12 lb/in2 (85 kPa) for most   dynamic stresses in general applications.    Allow for thermal expansion/contraction.  3M™ VHB™ Tapes can perform well in applications where two bonded surfaces may expand and contract di\u0000erentially.   Assuming good adhesion to the substrates, the tapes can typically tolerate di\u0000erential movement in the shear plane up to 3 times their thickness.   Bond Flexibility: While an advantage for many applications where allowing di\u0000erential movement is a bene\u0000t, the tape bonds are typically more \u0000exible than alternative   bonding methods. Suitable design modi\u0000cations or periodic use of rigid fasteners or adhesives may be needed if additional sti\u0000ness is required.   Performance in Severe Cold Temperature can be challenging. Applications which require performance at severe cold temperatures must be thoroughly evaluated by   the user if the intended use will subject the tape product to high impact stresses. A technical bulletin “3M™ VHB™ Tape Cold Temperature Performance” (70-0707- 3991-0) is available for additional information. 3M™ VHB™ Tape RP45 Design Considerations (continued) 3M™ VHB™ Tape RP45 Handling/Application Information Application Techniques Clean: Most substrates are best prepared by cleaning with a 50:50 mixture of isopropyl alcohol (IPA*) and water prior to applying 3M™ VHB™ Tapes.   Exceptions to the general procedure that may require additional surface preparation include:   • Heavy Oils: A degreaser or solvent-based cleaner may be required to remove heavy oil or grease from a surface and should be followed by cleaning with IPA/water.   • Abrasion: Abrading a surface, followed by cleaning with IPA/water, can remove heavy dirt or oxidation and can increase surface area to improve adhesion.   • Adhesion Promoters: Priming a surface can signi\u0000cantly improve initial and ultimate adhesion to many materials such as plastics and paints.   • Porous surfaces: Most porous and \u0000bered materials such as wood, particleboard, concrete, etc. need to be sealed to provide a uni\u0000ed surface.   • Unique Materials: Special surface preparation may be needed for glass and glass-like materials, copper and copper containing metals, and plastics or rubber that   contain components that migrate (e.g. plasticizers).   Refer to 3M Technical Bulletin “Surface Preparation for 3M™ VHB™ Tape Applications” for additional details and suggestions. (70-0704-8701-5)   *Note: These cleaner solutions contain greater than 250 g/l of volatile organic compounds (VOC). Please consult your local Air Quality Regulations to be sure the   cleaner is compliant. When using solvents, be sure to follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when handling such materials.   Pressure: Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm application pressure develops better adhesive contact and   helps improve bond strength. Typically, good surface contact can be attained by applying enough pressure to insure that the tape experiences approximately 15 psi   (100 kPa) pressure. Either roller or platen pressure can be used. Note that rigid surfaces may require 2 or 3 times that much pressure to make the tape experience 15   psi.   Temperature: Ideal application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Pressure sensitive adhesives use viscous \u0000ow to achieve substrate contact area.   Minimum suggested application temperature for the 3M™ VHB™ Tape RP family is 50°F (10°C).  Minimum application temperature does vary by 3M™ VHB™ tape   family and ranges from  32°F to 60°F (0°C to 15°C)   Note: Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below these suggested minimums is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere   readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory. To obtain good performance with all 3M™ VHB™ Tapes, it is important to   ensure that the surfaces are dry and free of condensed moisture.   Time: After application, the bond strength will increase as the adhesive \u0000ows onto the surface (also referred to as “wet out”). At room temperature approximately 50%   of ultimate bond strength will be achieved after 20 minutes, 90% after 24 hours and 100% after 72 hours. This \u0000ow is faster at higher temperatures and slower at lower   temperatures. Ultimate bond strength can be achieved more quickly (and in some cases bond strength can be increased) by exposure of the bond to elevated   temperatures (e.g. 150°F [66°C] for 1 hour). This can provide better adhesive wetout onto the substrates. Abrasion of the surfaces or the use of primers/ adhesion   promoters can also have the e\u0000ect of increasing bond strength and achieving ultimate bond strength more quickly.

Family Group ISO Statement 3M™ VHB™ Tape RP45 Storage and Shelf Life All 3M™ VHB™ Tapes have a shelf life of 24 months from date of manufacture when stored at 40°F to 100°F (4°C to 38°C) and 0-95% relative humidity. The optimum   storage conditions are 72°F (22°C) and 50% relative humidity.   Performance of tapes is not projected to change even after shelf life expires; however, 3M does suggest that 3M™ VHB™ Tapes are used prior to the shelf life date   whenever possible.   The manufacturing date is available on all 3M™ VHB™ Tapes as the lot number, typically marked on the core or on a label on the outer roll lap. The lot number,   typically a 4 digit code, is a Julian date (Y D D D). The \u0000rst digit refers to the year of manufacture, the last 3 digits refer to the days after January 1. Example: A lot   number of 7266 (or 17266) would translate to a date of manufacture of Sept. 23 (266th day of year) in 2017.
