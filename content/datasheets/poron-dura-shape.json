DuraShape  Option PORON polyurethanes are available with a  unique DuraShape option  a layer of  polyester film sealed between two layers of  PORON foam   The PORON DuraShape option can enhance  product reliability and longevity for  gasketing and sealing applications, while  facilitating faster, more accurate diecutting   Improve DieCutting Accuracy and  LongTerm Shape Retention The polyester layer adds dimensional  stability to  the  PORON DuraShape material  As a result, diecut parts have virtually no  shrinkage Once cut, gaskets and other parts  retain their shape over the long term This  benefits manufacturers by increasing the  reliability and longevity of their products  Increase Processing Speed and  Lower Costs  With enhanced dimensional stability in the  xy direction and tougher tear strength, the PORON DuraShape option may result in increased yields from highspeed die cutting  The polyester film layer inhibits the foam from stretching or shrinking, enabling faster processing and more accurate gasket shapes Sell Sheet PORON  DuraShape  Polyurethane   The PORON DuraShape Difference PORON materials are available with a tough polyester  film securely bonded between two layers of foam This  sandwich technology results in a foam product with  Increased dimensional stability  no shrinkage or stretching  Tougher tear strength  Reliable, longterm shape retention The DuraShape Option  a dds  a dvantages to  t hese  e nduring PORON  p olyurethane  b enefits   Durability and resiliency under pressure  Absorbs shock and vibration energy  Functional performance across a wide range of temperatures  Resistance to chemicals Superior Shape Retention The graph to the right shows elongation results for PORON  479092 with and without the   DuraShape material option   In dimensional stability tests, PORON unsupported foam  demonstrated elasticity while PORON DuraShape material  exhibited no elongation  Excellent Compressibility for Sealing Performance Compression Force Deflection CFD tests for PORON 470130  show that the PORON DuraShape material has the same  compressibility characteristics as PORON unsupported  materials  The high degree of compressibility for the  DuraShape material creates an additional option in gasket  and sealing designs with PORON foams  Product Offerings Standard PORON DuraShape materials are listed
