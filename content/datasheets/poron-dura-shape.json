The PORON Dura-Shape option can enhance  product reliability and longevity for  gasketing and sealing applications, while  facilitating faster, more accurate die-cutting.   Improve Die-Cutting Accuracy and  Long-Term Shape Retention The polyester layer adds dimensional  stability to  the  PORON Dura-Shape material.  As a result, die-cut parts have virtually no  shrinkage. Once cut, gaskets and other parts  retain their shape over the long term. This  benefits manufacturers by increasing the  reliability and longevity of their products.  Increase Processing Speed and  Lower Costs  With enhanced dimensional stability in the  x-y direction and tougher tear strength, the PORON Dura-Shape option may result in increased yields from high-speed die- cutting.  The polyester film layer inhibits the foam from stretching or shrinking, enabling faster processing and more accurate gasket shapes. Sell Sheet PORON®  Dura-Shape®  Polyurethane   The PORON Dura-Shape Difference PORON materials are available with a tough polyester  film securely bonded between two layers of foam. This  “sandwich” technology results in a foam product with: • Increased dimensional stability - no shrinkage or stretching • Tougher tear strength • Reliable, long-term shape retention The Dura-Shape Option  a dds  a dvantages to  t hese  e nduring PORON  p olyurethane  b enefits : • Durability and resiliency under pressure • Absorbs shock and vibration energy • Functional performance across a wide range of temperatures • Resistance to chemicals Superior Shape Retention The graph to the right shows elongation results for PORON  4790-92 with and without the   Dura-Shape material option.   In dimensional stability tests, PORON unsupported foam  demonstrated elasticity while PORON Dura-Shape material  exhibited no elongation.  Excellent Compressibility for Sealing Performance Compression Force Deflection (CFD) tests for PORON 4701-30  show that the PORON Dura-Shape material has the same  compressibility characteristics as PORON unsupported  materials.  The high degree of compressibility for the  Dura-Shape material creates an additional option in gasket  and sealing designs with PORON foams.  Product Offerings Standard PORON Dura-Shape materials are listed in the chart  to the right.  For non-standard thicknesses refer to the  Product Capabilities noted.
