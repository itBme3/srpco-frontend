Good wettability for better thermal conductivity     •   No siloxane gas/ oil bleeding ,   which   can   cause electric connection failure.   •   Good   flame retardan cy , UL94  V 2 rated, File # E239181     Product  Construction/Material Description     PET liner   Thermally conductive conformable layer   PET liner     Note:    The following technical information and data should be considered representative or typical  only and should not be used for  specification purposes.                 3M ™  Thermally  Conductive  Acrylic  Interface  Pad   5571N and 5571DL   Property   Value   Color   White   Base resin   Acrylic   Pad   Thickness   0.5 mm     Primary Filler Type   Ceramic   Product  Liner   PET Film   5571 N:   Single Liner   5571 DL:   Double Liner   Roll Length   Standard:   33   MT   Custom size can be supplied by user requests.   Technical Data |  April  2019   Applications    •   IC Packaging Heat Conduction   •   Heat Sink    •   COF Chip Heat Conduction   •   LED Board TIM   •   HD TV Address IC Chip and   Scan Module Board   •   General Gap Filling in Electronic Device     Mechanical fastening such as clamp, bracket, and screw can be used in parallel with this thermal conductive   pad .     Application Techniques   •   To obtain optimum thermal conductivity, the wetting  surfaces must be maximized. For better contact, clean,  dry and well unified surface condition is recommended. Typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol  and water (rubbing alcohol) or heptane. Note: Be sure to follow manufacturer’s safety prec autions and  directions for use when using solvents.   •   Ideal application temperature range is from  15 °C to 40°C. Initial application to surfaces at temperatures below  1 0°C is not recommended because the pad becomes too firm to be wetted readily. However, once   properly  applied, low   temperature holding is generally satisfactory     Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics    Note:    The following technical information and data should be considered representative or typical only and should not be use d for  specification purposes.     3M™ Thermally Conductive  Acrylic  Interface  Pad 5571 N   and 5571DL   Property   Method   Typical Value   Thickness (mm)   -   0.5   Thermal conductivity (W/m - K)   b   ASTM C1113   2.0   Thermal conductivity (W/m - K)   ASTM D5470   1.5   Hardness (Shore   00)   ASTM D2240   70   Density (grams/cm 3 )   ASTM D6111   1.85   Flammability    UL94   V - 2   Dielectric Strength (kV/mm)   ASTM D149   1 3   Volume Resistivity (Ω - cm)   ASTM D257   3.3 x 10 12     a   Methods listed  as ASTM are tested in accordance with the ASTM method noted   b   Thermal Conductivity Test Method :   •   2 . 0 W/m - K in XY direction per Hot wire plane Test method      Heat Resistance      *Note 1: Aged by dwelling at 110°C high temperature chamber.   *Note 2: The end use  customer application, design & verification testing will determine the final in use effective temperature range based on each   application’s environmental conditions.                       3M™ Thermally Conductive  Acrylic  Interface Pad 5571N and   5571DL   Duration (hrs)   Initial   1000   2000   5000   Thermal Conductivity (W/m - K)    2.0   2.0   2.0   2.0   Hardness (Shore 00)   69   70   70   70   Appearance   -   No effect   No effect   No effect     Storage and Shelf Life   The shelf life of 3M™ Thermally Conductive  Acrylic  Interface  Pad   5571N and 5571DL   is   12 months from the date of  manufacture when stored in the original packaging materials and stored at 21°C (70°F) and 50% relative humidity.
