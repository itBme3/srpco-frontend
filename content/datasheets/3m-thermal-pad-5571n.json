Pad   5571N  and 5571DL       Product Description   3M Thermally Conductive  Acrylic  Interface Pad  5571N and 5571DL   are   designated to provide a preferential heat  transfer path between   heat   generating components like Integrated Circuit Chip   IC   or electric vehicles EV and   heat  spreaders as aluminum heat sink 3M Thermally   Conductive  Acrylic  Interface Pad  5571N and  5571DL   consist of a  highly conformable slightly tacky acrylic elastomeric sheet filled with   conductive ceramic particles which provides  special features listed as follows     Key Features      Good softness       High ly   conformability even to non  flat IC surface s and  automotive batteries      Highly thermally conductive while being electrically insulating      Slight tack allows easy pre  assembly   Good wettability for better thermal conductivity        No siloxane gas oil bleeding ,   which   can   cause electric connection failure      Good   flame retardan cy , UL94  V 2 rated,

thermal conductive   pad      Application Techniques      To obtain optimum thermal conductivity, the wetting  surfaces must be maximized For better contact, clean,  dry and well unified surface condition is recommended Typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol  and water rubbing alcohol or heptane Note Be sure to follow manufacturers safety prec autions and  directions for use when using solvents      Ideal application temperature range is from  15 C to 40C Initial application to surfaces at temperatures below  1 0C is not recommended because the pad becomes too firm to be wetted readily However, once   properly  applied, low   temperature holding is generally satisfactory     Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics    Note    The following technical
