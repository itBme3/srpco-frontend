using the following test conditions Impacting Object  43 g acrylic ball  Height of Drop  305 cm  Procedure  The acrylic ball is dropped directly on the test material and the  impact force is measured PORON ShockPad 010mm and 015mm foam not only  absorbs a significant amount of impact force, but    displays excellent compression set resistance, is easy  to process, and performs reliably over the life of the final  product To learn more, visit RogerscorpcomShockPad or contact your local sales representative The trend toward thinner mobile devices drives the search for spacesaving impact solutions  As a result of these compact designs, the display, the printed wiring board, and other electrical  components are crowded into very thin spaces While a variety of materials can fill tight
