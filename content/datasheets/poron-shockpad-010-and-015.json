PORON ShockPad (0.10mm and 0.15mm) foam not only  absorbs a significant amount of impact force, but    displays excellent compression set resistance, is easy  to process, and performs reliably over the life of the final  product. To learn more, visit: Rogerscorp.com/ShockPad or contact your local sales representative. The trend toward thinner mobile devices drives the search for space-saving impact solutions.  As a result of these compact designs, the display, the printed wiring board, and other electrical  components are crowded into very thin spaces. While a variety of materials can fill tight gaps,  none have exhibited the type of vital impact protection seen in PORON ®  ShockPad foams.
