families     FRBNT Series naturalcolor, densified barrier   FRBNC Series naturalcolor, undensified barrier   FRBWT Series whitecoated, densified barrier   FRBBK Series blackcoated, densified barrier   FRBNT Laminate Series FRBNTPolyesterFRBNT laminate barrier   FRBNC Laminate Series FRBNCPolyesterFRBNC laminate barrier The key features of these products are  An inorganicbased, halogenfree material     per IEC 61249221 standard  Base material with UL 94 5VA flame rating five times more severe     flame than V0 test method  Excellent ignitability resistance  Excellent arc and track resistance  Good dielectric strength, made even better when densified or laminated     to polyester  Good rated thermal index of 130C for base material     tested only for FRBNT Series  Low outgassing for base material tested only for FRBNT Series  Dimensionally stable very low moisture absorption and very low     shrinkage at high temperature  Thin calipers with 5VA flame ratings  saves cost and weight     in enduse applications  Optional increased density for higher dielectric strength, a smoother     surface and a more closed cell structure  Optional white and black flameretardant coatings for excellent optical     and aesthetic results  Optional laminated product is manufactured with UL Recognized     UL 94 VTM2 PET film  Good convertibility  material is easily slit, cut, formed and die cut How the Flame Barrier FRB Series is  different  5VA flame rating is better than aramid, polypropylene  polycarbonate  130C rated thermal index RTI rating is better than     polypropylene  polycarbonate Target flame barrier applications   General purpose lighting luminaires including LED type  Electric and hybrid electric vehicles between batteries,     power converters, etc  Appliances vacuum cleaners, slow cookers, rice cookers, etc   Electrical devices timers, actuators, switches, etc The 3M TM  Flame Barrier FRB Series is flexible insulation for OEM electrical flame barrier applications The FRB Series products are made primarily  of inorganic materials that are intrinsically flame retardant with good dielectric strength 3M TM  Flame Barrier FRB Series Halogenfree is defined as having less than 900 ppm bromine, less than 900 ppm chlorine, and less than 1500 ppm total bromine and chlorine other halogens are excluded from  this definition These are levels set forth in certain industry standards, such as International Electrotechnical Commission IEC 61249221 standard This information is 3Ms current  knowledge and belief, which may be based in whole or in part on
