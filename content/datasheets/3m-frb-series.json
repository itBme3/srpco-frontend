The FRB Series products are made primarily  of inorganic materials that are intrinsically flame retardant with good dielectric strength. 3M TM  Flame Barrier FRB Series *Halogen-free is defined as having less than 900 ppm bromine, less than 900 ppm chlorine, and less than 1500 ppm total bromine and chlorine; other halogens are excluded from  this definition. These are levels set forth in certain industry standards, such as International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61249-2-21 standard.
