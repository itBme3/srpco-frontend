The 3M L1 tapes are designed to withstand temperatures up to 200°F (93°C) and   bond well to a wide range of foam substrates, including Polyurethane (PU) foam, Cross-Linked Polyethylene   (PE) foam, and Microcellular Urethane foam. All L1 constructions feature a white 74# densi\u0000ed kraft (DK) liner   for excellent processing. Product Features • The L1 adhesive is a modi\u0000ed acrylic adhesive that withstands temperatures up to 200°F (93°C).   • Adhesive o\u0000ers good initial tack and peel adhesion to many open cell foam materials.   • Bonds well to polyurethane (PU) foam, cross-linked polyethylene (PE) foam, and microcellular urethane   foam.   • An 74# white colored, unprinted densi\u0000ed kraft (PCK) liner for excellent processing. 3M™ Double Coated Polyester Tape L1 + DCP Technical Information Note The following technical information and data should be considered representative or typical only and should not be used for speci\u0000cation purposes. Typical Physical Properties Property Values Method Test Name Total Tape Thickness 0.097 mm 3.5 mil ASTM D3652 Adhesive Type Acrylic Liner 74# DK Liner Print None Liner Color White Primary Liner Thickness 0.103 mm 4.1 mil Product Construction L1+DCP is a 3.5 mil double- coated polyester (PET) tape   which provides added   dimensional stability and   improved handling during   laminating or die cutting   processes, particularly on thin   or \u0000exible substrates. An   adhesive coat weight of 1.5 mils   on each side of a 0.50 mil PET   carrier provides good adhesion   to many foam substrates.

Lower Service Temperature: -40°F (-40°C)   Humidity Resistance: High humidity has minimal e\u0000ect on adhesive performance. No signi\u0000cant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for 7 days at   90°F (32°C) and 90% relative humidity. Handling/Application Information Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm application will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with   the bonding surface.   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry, and well uni\u0000ed. Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane.*   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory. Storage and Shelf Life Store in original cartons at 70°F (21°C) and 50% relative humidity.   If stored under proper conditions, product retains its performance and properties for 24 months from the date of manufacture. Trademarks 3M is a trademark of 3M Company.
