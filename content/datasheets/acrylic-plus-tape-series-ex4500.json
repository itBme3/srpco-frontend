The product is available in 1.1 mm (45 mil) and 1.52  mm (60 mil) calipers.   Typical applications for 3M series EX4500 tapes include pillars, garnishes,  nested components and window visors, and other aftermarket accessories.  Product Features     Primerless adhesion capability – allowing for adhesion to medium surface  energy plastics without the use of adhesion promoter on both liner and  non-liner sides of the product.     Excellent adhesion to traditional, low surface energy, and scratch and mar  resistant automotive paints      Unique foam core that provides stress relaxation when high application  loads are encountered, while maintaining tight bond-line aesthetics under  normal conditions.       Deep black color which provides excellent bond-line appearance.  General 3M™ Acrylic  Plus  Tape Benefits     Viscoelastic Flexibility:  unique formula for excellent adhesion and stress  relaxation qualities that deliver conformability during thermal expansion  and in periods of high stress     Ease of Use:  tape can be die-cut into intricate shapes allowing for easy  peel and stick bonding  -  enabling attachment in areas where  mechanical attachment is difficult or impossible      Design Freedom:  enables easy differentiation of vehicle models by  providing flexibility to respond quickly to changes in design and  materials, allowing for easy installation of dealer installed accessories   Product Construction     EX4500     EX4500T     Technical Data Sheet  3M™ Acrylic  Plus  Tape Series EX4500                     2               Physical Properties    EX4508  EX4511  EX4515  Thickness  Range   N/A  1.14 mm (0.045 in) +/- 0.13  mm (0.005 in)   1.52 mm (0.060 in) +/- 0.13 mm  (0.005 in)   Density  Range     N/A  592 kg/m3 (37 lb/ft3) +/- 56  kg/m3 (3.5 lb/ft3)   576 kg/m3 (36 lb.ft3) +/- 56  kg/m3 (3.5 lb/ft3)   Roll  Widths     Available in the following standard widths:  o   Millimeter widths rounded to the nearest whole number and 1/8 inch increments starting with  1/4 inch  o   Minimum widths: 4 mm Levelwound, 5 mm Planetary (Standard versions)     Width tolerance:   o   +/- 0.4 mm for planetary rolls up to 18 mm wide and level wound rolls +/- 0.8 mm for  planetary rolls wider than 18 mm   Core   Black, Acrylic Foam   Adhesive     JLx-2 on the liner-side of the tape for robust adhesion to MSE plastics without use of primer     JLx-1 on the non-liner side of the tape for adhesion to medium surface energy, and scratch- and mar- resistant automotive paint systems   Liner     EX4500:  3M Branded, red polyethylene, 2-sided silicone-coated on both sides for easy release     EX4500T:  3M Branded, red polyethylene, 1-sided silicone-coated liner on Levelwound Rolls to  enable heat - bond tabbing   Tabbing     An extended liner tab is recommended     Tape available with tabbable liner option:  3M™ Acrylic  Plus  Tape EX4500T     Heat-bond tabbing: 3M™ Tabbing Tapes 5081 and 5400 for T-liner versions     PSA Tabbing: 3M™ Tabbing and Splicing Tape 5699 for silicone liners, 3M™ Tabbing Tape 5300 for  non - silicone liners   Splices     Number of splices depends on order quantity or roll length     Level wound rolls have an average of 3 to 4 splices     Smaller order quantities (smaller than   one jumbo) rolls could contain up to 14 splices   Performance Properties  Typical performance of 3M™ Acrylic  Plus  Tape EX4511 is shown below. Peel values depend on plastic substrate  characteristics and/or paint composition. These values are for reference only.   Notes:    1.   The following technical information and data is based upon limited 3M testing conditions and should not be used  for specification purposes.    2.   Care should be taken to make sure the surface is clean and dry prior to application of the tape and not to saturate  the tape with strong polar solvents, like alcohols, after initial application.   3.   After adhesion build, the JLx adhesive is durable to typical automotive environmental conditions and chemicals and  provides a robust attachment solution.  For questions regarding the application process, please contact your 3M  technical representative.   4.   When using solvents, extinguish all ignition sources, including pilot lights and follow the manufacturer's precautions  and directions for use.
