This tape is specially designed for ex terior and interior parts attachments of automobiles.    The Acrylic Foam Tape can work well on the TOYOTA  Anti Acid Paint and Scratch Resistant Paint.      Features :  * To the TOYOTA Anti Acid Rain Pa int and Scratch Resistant Paint surface  a) Meets the TOYOTA specification of “The pressure  sensitive adhesive double coated t ape for exterior parts”, and      has a superior initial adhesion performance and durability.  b) Has the same workability as the  standard type on the conventional paint.  c) Doesn’t detach from the paint surface bec ause of a superior stress relaxation properties.  d) Still has a superior adhesion performance on the convent ional paint surface, and can be used for the same      applications as the standar d type acrylic foam tape.  *Follows the shrinkage and elongation of the plastic par t caused by the temperature change, and has good stress    relaxation properties which are very import ant for the automotive parts attachments.    *Provides a very high final adhesion and peeling strength.   *Excels in a variety of weather, so lvent and high temperature resistance.
