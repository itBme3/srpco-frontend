the attachment of impervious faceplate materials such as aluminum to a stainless steel test surface   Bond Buildup The bond strength of 3M Adhesive 300LSE increased as a function of time and temperature, and has very high initial adhesion   Humidity Resistance High humidity has a minimal eect on adhesive performance No signicant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for 7 days at   90F 32C and 90 relative humidity   UV Resistance When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely aected by exposure   Water Resistance Immersion in water has no appreciable eect on the bond strength After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained   Temperature Cycling Resistance High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through             4 hours at 158F 70C             4 hours at 20F 29C             4 hours at 73F 22C   Chemical Resistance When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids   and alkalis   Temperature Resistance 3M Adhesive 300LSE is usable for short periods minutes, hours at temperatures up to 300F 148C and for intermittent longer periods   of time days, weeks up to 200F 93C   Lower Service Temperature 40F 40C Processing Slitting and diecutting This adhesive is very aggressive and may be dicult to convert depending on your application requirements Chilling the adhesive between   35F and 50F will improve the processability In addition, dies can be lubricated with evaporative stamping oil You

refer to the Technical Bulletin on slitting 700709 39056 HandlingApplication Information Application Examples  Plastic nameplates or graphic overlays for use on low surface energy plastics    Waste removed nameplates on a common sheet for ease of application    Attaching membrane switch assemblies to powder coated surfaces and low surface energy plastics    Graphic overlays with end tabs for easy liner removal    Graphic application to surfaces such as wood, fabric, plastic, where very high bond strength is required    Attaching identication material to lightly oily surfaces typical of machine parts Family Group 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape 9471LE HandlingApplication Information continued Application Techniques For maximum bond strength, the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried Typical cleaning solvents are methyl ethyl ketone for metals or isopropyl alcohol for   plastics Carefully read and follow manufacturers precautions and directions for use when using cleaning solvents   Bond strength can also be improved with rm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100F 38C to 130F 54C, causing the adhesive to develop intimate   contact with the bonding surface   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   for most pressuresensitive adhesives because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory Storage and Shelf Life Store at room temperature conditions of 70F 21C and 50 relative humidity   If stored properly, product retains its performance and properties for 24 months from date of manufacture Trademarks 3M is a trademark of 3M Company References Property
