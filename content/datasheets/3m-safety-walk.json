or Rubber Mallet 1 Individual pieces should be spaced a minimu m of 12 apart and a maximum of 2 apart 2 Round the corners of any pieces cut from rolls 3 Peel protective liner back about 2 fr om one end and position piece on surface IMPORTANT NOTE i Minimize touching adhesive with fingers 4 Continue to remove liner Press firm ly in place as liner is removed 5 For small pieces Peel liner off piece Holding piece by its edge s, curve it gently with the adhesive side out Align the mid dle of the piece  over the middle of the targ et surface and press down 6 Finally, press into firm contact with su rface using a rubber hand roller by star ting in middle and rolling out toward edges 7 For applying 3M SafetyWalk Conformable Tapes and Treads, use  a softheaded rubber mallet to ensure product conformability  to surface Pound edges extra hard 8 On steps, apply tread material 12 from stair  edge to prevent edge curl and premature wear Maintenance Instructions    To maintain product effectiv eness, the application should  be inspected periodically    To ensure that 3M SafetyWalk SlipResista nt Materials are kept free of dirt and oth er residue that might impair functionali ty  Coarse, General Purpose  and Conformable tapes and treads sh ould be deck brushed regularly  Medium and Fine Resilient Treads should  be mopped or deck brushed regularly    Use an appropriate degreasercleaner for  general maintenance to keep  material and surrounding surfaces dirt and grease free    To remove and replace worn or torn material  Start by pulling up old material Use of  a heat gun may assist in this process  After removal of old material, use 3M Genera l Purpose Adhesive Remover 089 87 or an equivalent product to soften adhesive res  idue and allow scraping of surface in  preparation for product replacement    As 3M SafetyWalk should be replaced as you  observe mineral wear or loss from its surface Important for Prop er Application and Service Life 1 All surfaces must be clean, dry and at reco mmended temperature before applying product 2 Rough or porous surfaces must be primed wi th 3M SafetyWalk Primer  for proper adhesion 3 A 3M SafetyWalk Rubber Hand Roller should  be used to assure a firm bond when appl ying all SafetyWalk slipresistant mater ials 4 For extra protection from excessive moistu re or liquids, use 3M SafetyWalk Edging  Compound SafetyWalk slipresistant mat e rials are not recommended for continuous immersion in water 5 3M SafetyWalk SlipResistant Material ca n be applied on most painted surfaces that  are in good condition The material wil l adhere  as well as the base paint Painted surfaces  must be thoroughly dry before applicatio n of any 3M SafetyWalk SlipResistant Ma terial 6 Treated or untreated wood must be  painted prior to application of 3M  SafetyWalk SlipResistant Material 7 Do not apply 3M SafetyWalk SlipResis tant Material over surfaces with consta nt water contact or moisture seepage 8 Do not apply 3M SafetyWalk SlipResista nt Material over grouting Avoid cracks  in concrete and cracks in any surface 9 3M SafetyWalk SlipResistant Materials  are not recommended for quarry tile in  commercial kitchens due to constant oil expo sure 10   Store product in its origin al carton, preferably at 40F 4C to 100 F 377C Humidity range of 40 to 60 11 It is recommended to use the pr oduct within five years from  the date product is received IMPORTANT NOTE i 3M SafetyWalk Slip Resistant Tapes and Tr eads Series 200, 300, 500, 600, and  700 have been certified by the National  Floor Safety Institute NFSI as providing  high traction A wet static coefficient of  friction SCOF of greater than 060 wa s chosen  by NFSI as the criteria for high traction  because according to NFSI, floor surfaces  maintaining this leve l of slip resistance  when  wet have proven to reduce slipand fall claims by between 50 and 90 8  9 Technical Data Sheet Revision K, March 2020 3M SafetyWalk SlipResistant Tapes and Treads IMPORTANT NOTE i
