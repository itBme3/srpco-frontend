Surface Preparation 1 - Use solvent suitable for removing grease and oil.  Follow manufacturer's directions for proper handling.  2 - Use detergent, degreaser or stripping chemical as appropriate. 3 - Untreated and treated wood must be painted before application of any 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Slip-Resistant Materials.  4 - Not recommended for use in commercial kitchens. Directions for Use IMPORTANT NOTE i Prior to printing on 3M™ Safety -Walk™ 588 or 688 series review 3M™ Safety-Wal k™ General Printing Guidelines to ensure  proper awareness and process is understood.  Surface Preparation Instructions 1. Make sure surface is clean, dry, smooth  and above minimum application temperature wh en applying 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Slip-Resista nt  material. Repair or replace an y broken or damaged surface. Minimum application temperatures: Coarse (700 series)                     40ºF (4ºC) General Purpose (600 series)     40ºF (4ºC) Conformable (500 series)           40ºF (4ºC) Medium Resilient (300 series)    40ºF (4ºC) Fine Resilient (200 series)           50ºF (10ºC) 2. Remove chipped, cracked or peeled p aint prior to applying Safety-Walk material. 3. Remove loose residue from surface. 4. If present, floor finish may be removed prior to application. 5. Referring to the \"Surface Preparation Table\"  on page 6, use the appropriate cleaner  or solvent wipe to clean the surface. Aft er cleaning,  allow surface to dry thoroughly. Priming Instructions 1. Prime clean, dry surfaces with  3M™ Safety-Walk™ Primer, especially: a.   Uncoated concrete surfaces. b.  Coated, painted or porous concrete if surface is excessively rough. c.   Other porous surfaces. 2. Priming Instructions a.   Properly clean the surface following the  \"Surface Preparation Table\" on page 6. b.  Use a paint brush to apply a thin coat of 3M™ Sa fety-Walk™ primer where ma terial is to be placed. c.   Allow the primed area to dry thoroughly (no evidence of sticki ness or tackiness) before applyi ng Safety-Walk slip-resistant m aterial.  Approximate drying time is 15 minutes.

Individual pieces should be spaced a minimu m of 1/2\" apart and a maximum of 2\" apart. 2. Round the corners of any pieces cut from rolls. 3. Peel protective liner back about 2\" fr om one end and position piece on surface. IMPORTANT NOTE i Minimize touching adhesive with fingers. 4. Continue to remove liner. Press firm ly in place as liner is removed. 5. For small pieces: Peel liner off piece. Holding piece by its edge s, curve it gently with the adhesive side out. Align the mid dle of the piece  over the middle of the targ et surface and press down. 6. Finally, press into firm contact with su rface using a rubber hand roller by star ting in middle and rolling out toward edges. 7. For applying 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Conformable Tapes and Treads, use  a soft-headed rubber mallet to ensure product conformability  to surface. Pound edges extra hard. 8. On steps, apply tread material 1/2\" from stair  edge to prevent edge curl and premature wear. Maintenance Instructions •   To maintain product effectiv eness, the application should  be inspected periodically. •   To ensure that 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Slip-Resista nt Materials are kept free of dirt and oth er residue that might impair functionali ty: - Coarse, General Purpose  and Conformable tapes and treads sh ould be deck brushed regularly. - Medium and Fine Resilient Treads should  be mopped or deck brushed regularly. •   Use an appropriate degreaser/cleaner for  general maintenance to keep  material and surrounding surfaces dirt and grease free. •   To remove and replace worn or torn material: - Start by pulling up old material. Use of  a heat gun may assist in this process. - After removal of old material, use 3M™ Genera l Purpose Adhesive Remover (089 87) or an equivalent product to soften adhesive res - idue and allow scraping of surface in  preparation for product replacement. •   As 3M™ Safety-Walk™ should be replaced as you  observe mineral wear or loss from its surface. Important for Prop er Application and Service Life 1. All surfaces must be clean, dry and at reco mmended temperature before applying product. 2. Rough or porous surfaces must be primed wi th 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Primer  for proper adhesion. 3. A 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Rubber Hand Roller should  be used to assure a firm bond when appl ying all Safety-Walk slip-resistant mater ials. 4. For extra protection from excessive moistu re or liquids, use 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Edging  Compound. Safety-Walk slip-resistant mat e- rials are not recommended for continuous immersion in water. 5. 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Slip-Resistant Material ca n be applied on most painted surfaces that  are in good condition. The material wil l adhere  as well as the base paint. Painted surfaces  must be thoroughly dry before applicatio n of any 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Slip-Resistant Ma terial. 6. Treated or untreated wood must be  painted prior to application of 3M ™ Safety-Walk™ Slip-Resistant Material. 7. Do not apply 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Slip-Resis tant Material over surfaces with consta nt water contact or moisture seepage. 8. Do not apply 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Slip-Resista nt Material over grouting. Avoid cracks  in concrete and cracks in any surface. 9. 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Slip-Resistant Materials  are not recommended for quarry tile in  commercial kitchens due to constant oil expo sure. 10.   Store product in its origin al carton, preferably at 40°F (4°C) to 100° F (37.7°C). Humidity range of 40% to 60%. 11. It is recommended to use the pr oduct within five years from  the date product is received. IMPORTANT NOTE i 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Slip Resistant Tapes and Tr eads Series 200, 300, 500, 600, and  700 have been certified by the National  Floor Safety Institute (NFSI) as providing  \"high traction\". A wet static coefficient of  friction (SCOF) of greater than 0.60 wa s chosen  by NFSI as the criteria for \"high traction \" because according to NFSI, floor surfaces  maintaining this leve l of slip resistance  when  wet have proven to reduce slip-and -fall claims by between 50% and 90%. 8 / 9 Technical Data Sheet Revision K, March 2020 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Slip-Resistant Tapes and Treads IMPORTANT NOTE i 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Slip-Resistant Conform able  Tapes and Treads - 500 Series is not pr esently qualified to, nor on the qualified  products list associated with, an y active Military Specification. 3M™ Safety-Walk™ Slip-Resistant General Pu rpose Tapes and Treads - 600 Series met,  and was on the qualified products list  associated with, Military Specification MI L-D-17951 E, which was canceled upon the  release of Military Specification MIL-PRF-  24667 C.
