Coated Urethane Foam Tape 4004 Product Description 3M Double Coated Urethane Foam Tapes are conformable foams that oer high shear strength with a high   temperature holding acrylic adhesive system for bonding to various types of surfaces for mounting, joining   and holding Product Features  The natural colored urethane foam tape products vary in color from white to light yellow The color will   change to light yellow upon exposure to sunlight ultraviolet radiation This color change is normal and does   not aect tape performance 3M Double Coated Urethane Foam Tape 4004 Technical Information

btuinhftF HandlingApplication Information Application Examples The urethane foam tapes are generally ideal for interior applications or for exterior applications where the tape will be protected from the environment The urethane   foam is open cell   3M Double Coated Urethane Foam Tape 4004  Mount interior signs and nameplates Application Techniques  Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and   improve bond strength    To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unied Typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol and water rubbing   alcohol or heptane    Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory   Note Be sure to follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when using solvents Storage and Shelf Life Store in original cartons at 70F 21C and 50 relative humidity   To obtain best performance, use these products within 24 months from date of manufacture Trademarks 3M is a trademark of 3M Company References Property Values 3mcom Product Page
