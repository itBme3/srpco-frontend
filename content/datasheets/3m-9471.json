highershows no signicant reduction after exposure   for 7 days at 90F 32C and 90 relative humidity   UV Resistance  When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely aected by outdoor exposure   Water Resistance  Immersion in water has no appreciable eect on the bond strength After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength increasesis   maintained   Temperature Cycling Resistance  High bond strength is maintained increases after cycling four times through             4 hours at 158F 70C             4 hours at 20F 29C             4 hours at 73F 22C   Chemical Resistance  When properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids   and alkalis   Bond Buildup The bond strength of 3M Adhesive 300 increases as a function of time and temperature   TemperatureHeat Resistance Adhesive 300 is usable for short periods minutes, hours at temperatures up to 250F 120C and for intermittent longer periods days,   weeks up to 150F 65C   Lower Temperature Service Limit 40F 40C HandlingApplication Information Application Examples  Long term bonding of graphic nameplates and overlays to surfaces such as metal and low surface energy plastics in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment,   automotive, appliance and electronic markets    Bonding metal nameplates and rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronic markets    Lamination to foam for gasket application 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape 9471 HandlingApplication Information continued Application Techniques For maximum bond strength during installation of the nal part the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried Typical cleaning solvents are heptane for oily   surfaces or isopropyl alcohol for plastics Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the   drying eect on skin These oils can interfere with the performance of a pressuresensitive adhesive   Consult solvent manufacturers MSDS for proper handling and storage instructions Also, use disposable wipes that do not contain oils, to remove the cleaning solvents   It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination 1520 PLI recommended and during nal part installation 1015 PLI to allow to adhesive the come into direct   contact with the substrate Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of   lamination Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks For   plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat   The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 70F 21C to 100F 38C Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50F 10C   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory please refer to the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics section   When bonding a thin, smooth, exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of adhesive If a texture is visible on one or both surfaces,   the 5 mil adhesive would be suggested If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the components 3M VHB   Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required please refer to data page 70070938637 Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality To learn more about working with pressuresensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives 70070414308   For additional dispenser
