These state-of-the-art  materials have been  refined, tested and  proven in a wide variety  of applications . Use 3M ™  Flexible  Insulation for: •  Ground, phase and interwinding  insulation for dry-type transformers •  Slot, phase and wedge insulation for  electric motors and generators •  Flame barrier insulation for appliances •  Collars for voice coils used in  speakers •  Wire and cable wrap •  Layer insulation used in cast coil  transformers Voltage endurance 3M Flexible Insulation retains a high  percentage of dielectric strength  even after extended exposure to  high operating temperatures while  its inorganic content helps reduce  damage caused by partial discharge. Thermal conductivity The high thermal conductivity of  flexible insulation helps achieve  the heat dissipation required  in today’s electrical apparatus,  allowing more efficient operation  or the design of smaller, more  cost-effective equipment. Inorganic paper technology offers: Varnish absorption The good varnish absorption  characteristics of flexible  insulation can enhance its already  high thermal conductivity, helping  equipment to run cooler, quieter,  and last longer. Low moisture  absorption Manufactured with less than  1% moisture content, flexible  insulation papers exhibit  dimensional stability even in  humid environments and do not  require extended drying time  prior to varnish saturation. 4    |    3M Flexible Insulations 3M ™  ThermaVolt  Calendered Inorganic  Insulating Paper For high-temperature electrical  insulation applications up to Class  220(R), the high thermal conductivity  of 3M ThermaVolt Electrical Insulation  Paper helps achieve the heat dissipation  required in today’s electrical apparatus,  allowing more efficient operation or the  design of smaller, more cost-effective  equipment. 3M ThermaVolt AR (TVAR)  paper combines the long-recognized  advantages of 3M ThermaVolt   paper with improved    mechanical properties.

Polyester film can provide mechanical support for  inorganic insulating paper. However, considering  the thermal, mechanical, electrical, and UL factors  together can be complex. What are the thermal  capabilities of  polyester film? Polyester film is a component rated as a 130°C  material; it will shrink and embrittle when aged  at high temperatures. The primary mode of this  degradation is oxidation. However, Lamination  will help slow this process as will properly applied  varnish or impregnation. As the film slowly oxidizes,  it breaks down into its constituent chemicals which  do not attack other components nor carbonize the  film. This “friendly” degradation is one of the reasons  that polyethyleneterepthalate (PET) polyester film is  so widely used in electrical insulation applications.  Despite the concern of some that this 130°C material  will melt, the actual melting point of PET polyester  film is over 240ºC. Although it will begin to lose  mechanical strength at high temperatures, polyester  film can withstand short-term thermal excursions if  protected from oxidation. Won't polyester film shrink  and embrittle at high  temperatures?  Shrinkage and embrittlement due to thermal aging can  be addressed through equipment design.  For example,  in a tightly wound unit a 3M ™  CeQUIN Inorganic  Insulating Laminates (paper/polyester) will be held in  place, greatly reducing shrinkage.  Likewise, a tightly  wound, well-varnished coil will significantly reduce  mechanical stress and vibration that could affect the  polyester film portion of the laminate as it ages. How long have polyester  film laminates been used? From a historical perspective, inorganic papers  laminated with polyester film have been used  successfully for more than 40 years in Class 220(R)  coil applications, ranging from small H.I.D. ballast  transformers to medium size dry-type distribution  transformers. For example, 3M CeQUIN IF inorganic  insulating paper laminate is used as a wire wrap in  the manufacture of a 250°C-rated appliance wiring  material (UL Style 5288/CSA Class 1, Group A/B)  for use in high-temperature, severe environments.  The acceptance of inorganic insulating paper  paper-polyester film laminates for use in these high  performance applications speaks for itself. 14    |    3M Flexible Insulations UL recognition 3M ™  Flexible Insulations have  undergone extensive thermal  aging evaluation per UL 1446,  “Standard for Systems of Insulating  Materials – General.” As a result  they are UL Recognized for use  as major insulation in electrical  insulation systems as listed under  3M Innovative Paper Technologies  File No. E65007 and may be found  on UL’s Electrical Insulation Systems  Database at http://data.ul.com/ systems/. All systems listed on this  database are available for use by any  electrical apparatus manufacturer  by contacting the nearest UL office  UL 1446 systems with 3M Flexible  Insulations also comply with IEC  Publication 85.  Recommended  usage Optimum performance of an  electrical insulation system is  dependent upon many factors  including proper choice of materials,  acceptable design criteria, and  good manufacturing procedures.  Varnishing is recommended for  construction of equipment that may  be exposed to the elements. For  design purposes, it is recommended  that operating electrical stresses  in electrical apparatus not exceed  40 V/mil (1.6 kV/mm) in order to  minimize the risk of partial discharge.
