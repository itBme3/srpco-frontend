the most  rigorous applications   These stateoftheart  materials have been  refined, tested and  proven in a wide variety  of applications  Use 3M   Flexible  Insulation for   Ground, phase and interwinding  insulation for drytype transformers   Slot, phase and wedge insulation for  electric motors and generators   Flame barrier insulation for appliances   Collars for voice coils used in  speakers   Wire and cable wrap   Layer insulation used in cast coil  transformers Voltage endurance 3M Flexible Insulation retains a high  percentage of dielectric strength  even after extended exposure to  high operating temperatures while  its inorganic content helps reduce  damage caused by partial discharge Thermal conductivity The high thermal conductivity of  flexible insulation helps achieve  the heat dissipation required  in todays electrical apparatus,  allowing more efficient operation  or the design of smaller, more  costeffective equipment Inorganic paper technology offers Varnish absorption The good varnish absorption  characteristics of flexible  insulation can enhance its already  high thermal conductivity, helping  equipment to run cooler, quieter,  and last longer Low moisture  absorption Manufactured with less than  1 moisture content, flexible  insulation papers exhibit  dimensional stability even in  humid environments and do not  require extended drying time  prior to varnish saturation 4        3M Flexible Insulations 3M   ThermaVolt  Calendered Inorganic  Insulating Paper For hightemperature electrical  insulation applications up to Class  220R,

inorganic insulating paper However, considering  the thermal, mechanical, electrical, and UL factors  together can be complex What are the thermal  capabilities of  polyester film Polyester film is a component rated as a 130C  material it will shrink and embrittle when aged  at high temperatures The primary mode of this  degradation is oxidation However, Lamination  will help slow this process as will properly applied  varnish or impregnation As the film slowly oxidizes,  it breaks down into its constituent chemicals which  do not attack other components nor carbonize the  film This friendly degradation is one of the reasons  that polyethyleneterepthalate PET polyester film is  so widely used in electrical insulation applications  Despite the concern of some that this 130C material  will melt, the actual melting point of PET polyester  film is over 240C Although it will begin to lose  mechanical strength at high temperatures, polyester  film can withstand shortterm thermal excursions if  protected from oxidation Wont polyester film shrink  and embrittle at high  temperatures  Shrinkage and embrittlement due to thermal aging can  be addressed through equipment design  For example,  in a tightly wound unit a 3M   CeQUIN Inorganic  Insulating Laminates paperpolyester will be held in  place, greatly reducing shrinkage  Likewise, a tightly  wound, wellvarnished coil will significantly reduce  mechanical stress and vibration that could affect the  polyester film portion of the laminate as it ages How long have polyester  film laminates been used From a historical perspective, inorganic papers  laminated with polyester film have been used  successfully for more than 40 years in Class 220R  coil applications, ranging from small HID ballast  transformers to medium size drytype distribution  transformers For example, 3M CeQUIN IF inorganic  insulating paper laminate is used as a wire wrap in  the manufacture of a 250Crated appliance wiring  material UL Style 5288CSA Class 1, Group AB  for use in hightemperature, severe environments  The acceptance of inorganic insulating paper  paperpolyester film laminates for use in these high  performance applications speaks for itself 14        3M Flexible Insulations UL recognition 3M   Flexible Insulations have  undergone extensive thermal  aging evaluation per UL 1446,  Standard for Systems of Insulating  Materials  General As a result  they are UL Recognized for use  as major insulation in electrical  insulation systems as listed under  3M Innovative Paper Technologies  File No E65007 and may be found  on ULs Electrical Insulation Systems  Database at httpdataulcom systems All systems listed on this  database are available for use by any  electrical apparatus manufacturer  by contacting the nearest UL office  UL 1446 systems with 3M Flexible  Insulations also comply with IEC  Publication 85  Recommended  usage Optimum performance of an  electrical insulation system is  dependent upon many factors  including proper choice of materials,  acceptable design criteria, and  good manufacturing procedures  Varnishing is recommended for  construction of equipment that may  be exposed to the elements For  design purposes, it is recommended  that operating electrical stresses  in electrical apparatus not exceed  40 Vmil 16 kVmm in order to  minimize the risk of partial discharge UL recognition 3M Flexible Insulations      15 Other 3M insulating products Insulating   Conductive Tapes 3M offers a wide variety of electrical  and electronic insulating tapes  for
