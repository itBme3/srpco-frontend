Bond strength shows no signi\u0000cant reduction after exposure for 7 days at 90°F   (32°C) and 90% relative humidity.   UV Resistance – When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely a\u0000ected by outdoor exposure.   Water Resistance – Immersion in water has no appreciable e\u0000ect on the bond strength. After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained.   Temperature Cycling Resistance – High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through:             4 hours at 158°F (70°C)             4 hours at -20°F (-29°C)             4 hours at 73°F (22°C)   Chemical Resistance – When properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids   and alkalis.   Bond Build-up: The bond strength of 3M™ High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP increases as a function of time and temperature   Temperature/Heat Resistance: 3M™ High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP is usable for short periods (minutes, hours) at temperatures up to400°F (204°C) and   for intermittent longer periods (days, weeks) up to 300°F (149°C).   Lower Temperature Service Limit: The glass transition temperature for 3M™ High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 200MP is -31°F (-35°C). Many applications survive   below this temperature (factors a\u0000ecting successful applications include: materials being bonded, dwell at RT before cold exposure, and stress below the   TG[i.e.expansion/contraction stresses, impact]). Optimum conditions are: bonding high surface energy materials, longer time at RT before cold exposure, and little or   no stress below the TG. The lowest service temperature is -40°F (-40°C). Handling/Application Information Application Examples • Long term bonding of graphic nameplates and overlays (“subsurface” printed polycarbonate or polyester) to metal and high surface energy plastics in the aerospace,   medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets.   • Bonding metal nameplates and rating plates in the aerospace, medical and industrial equipment, automotive, appliance and electronics markets.   • Bonding graphic overlays for membrane switches and for bonding the complete switch to the equipment surface.   • High speed processing of parts in the medical, telecommunications and electronics markets (medical components, durable labels, and \u0000exible circuits).   • Lamination to industrial foams for rotary die-cutting of small gaskets for industrial and electronics markets. 3M™ Adhesive Transfer Tape 9667MP Handling/Application Information (continued) Application Techniques For maximum bond strength (during installation of the \u0000nal part) the surface should be thoroughly cleaned and dried. Typical cleaning solvents are heptane (for oily   surfaces) or isopropyl alcohol for plastics. Use reagent grade solvents since common household materials like rubbing alcohol frequently contain oils to minimize the   drying a\u0000ect on skin and can interfere with the performance of a pressure-sensitive adhesive.   *Note: Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when working with solvents. These cleaning recommendations may not be in   compliance with the rules of certain air quality management districts in California; consult applicable rules before use.   It is necessary to provide pressure during lamination (1.5-20 pli recommended) and during \u0000nal part installation (10-15 psi) to allow the adhesive to come into direct   contact with the substrate. Using a hard edged plastic tool, which is the full width of the laminated part, helps to provide the necessary pressure at the point of   lamination. Heat can increase bond strength when bonding to metal parts (generally this same increase is observed at room temperature over longer times, weeks). For   plastic parts, the bond strength is not enhanced with the addition of heat.   The ideal adhesive application temperature range is 60°F (15.6°C) to 100°F (38°C). Application is not recommended if the surface temperature is below 50°F (10°C)   because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. Once properly applied, at the recommended application temperature, low temperature holding is generally   satisfactory (please refer to section VII of the Typical Physical Properties and Performance Characteristics).   When bonding a thin, smooth, \u0000exible material to a smooth surface, it is generally acceptable to use 2 mils of 3M™ Adhesive 200MP. If a texture is visible on one or   both surfaces, the 5 mil 3M adhesive 200MP would be suggested. If both materials are rigid, it may be necessary to use a thicker adhesive to successfully bond the   components. 3M™ VHB™ Acrylic Foam Tapes may be required (please refer to the data page 70-0709-3830-6).   To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality. To learn more about working with pressure-sensitive   adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives (70-0704-1430-8).

Storage and Shelf Life It is suggested that products are stored at room temperature conditions of 70°F (21°C) and 50% relative humidity.   If stored properly, product retains its performance and properties for 24 months from date of manufacture. Trademarks 3M is a trademark of 3M Company.
