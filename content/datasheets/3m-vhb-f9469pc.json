Transfer Tape F9469PC Product Description Finite Element Analysis FEA  data is available for this product at  3mcomFEA 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9469PC utilizes the 3M High Performance Acrylic Adhesive 100MP,   which has excellent long term holding power with much higher adhesion strength than typical pressure   sensitive adhesive systems This 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape is transparent and is ideal for use in   many interior and exterior industrial applications to replace rivets, spot welds, liquid adhesives, and other   permanent fasteners 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9469PC Technical Information Note The following technical information and data should be considered representative or typical only and should not be used for specication purposes Typical Physical Properties Property Values Method Total Tape Thickness 013 mm 52 mil ASTM D3652 Adhesive Type Acrylic Density 1012 gcm 004 lbin Liner 58 Polycoated Kraft Liner Print 3M VHB Liner Thickness 0106 mm 42 mil UL Listing 3M Adhesive 100MP has UL 746C listings with dierent temperature ratings on many commonly used substrate materials as indicated in the table below   Qualication for this listing requires high strength retention after extended exposure to high temperatures, humidity, cold, and cyclic conditions   Substrates Temperature Rating   Stainless Steel, GlassEpoxy, Enameled Steel, Ceramic, Phenolic, Nickel Plated Steel 110C   ABS, Polycarbonate, Aluminum, Galvanized Steel 90C   Unplasticized PVC 75C Our testing has shown that 3M Adhesive 100MP yielded 92 retention of peel adhesion after the roll was aged for more than 5 years at an elevated temperature of   150F 65C The initial tack and liner release properties were still excellent This testing result suggests that the tape is relatively unaected by longterm exposure to   elevated temperatures Bonds made with 3M Adhesive 100MP can tolerate periodic shortterm exposures to temperatures up to 500F 260C   3M Adhesive 100MP is thermoplastic in nature, becoming softer as temperature increases and rmer as temperature decreases As the adhesive becomes rmer, the   performance generally increases This performance increase is demonstrated graphically in Figure 1 for 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9473PC It shows the   breakaway and peel forces as a function of temperature The exception of the performance increase is at very low temperatures when high impact stresses along with   high frequencies are encountered At low temperatures, the tape becomes very rm and glassy the ability to absorb impact energy is reduced 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9469PC Dynamic Mechanical Properties For engineers who have to use adhesive properties for modeling and analysis purpose, we suggest a Youngs modulus of 45  102 kPA measured at 23C  1 Hz and   a Poissons ratio of 0499 For detailed adhesive modulus and damping properties, please refer to the nomograph for 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tapes, which is   available upon request through our technical service group The nomograph presents adhesive modulus and damping properties as functions of temperature and   frequency Typical Performance Characteristics Additional Test notes 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tapes F9460PC, F9469PC, and F9473PC are made from the same adhesive system and are thermoplastic in nature, becoming softer   as temperature increases and rmer as temperature decreases As the adhesive becomes rmer, the adhesion performance generally increases At low temperatures   lower than 40F 40C, the 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape becomes very rm and glassy the ability to absorb impact energy is reduced In contrast,   adhesion strength reduces with increasing temperatures Typical adhesive strength properties at room temperatures are shown below Solvent

F9469PC HandlingApplication Information Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and improve   bond strength   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry, and well unied Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcoholwater mixture or   heptane   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory   Note Be sure to follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use when using solvents Storage and Shelf Life Humidity controlled storage 60 to 80F 16 to 27C and 4060 RH   If stored properly, product retains its performance and properties for 24 months from date of manufacture If the products have been exposed to severe weather   conditions, we suggest to precondition the products at the above storage conditions for at least 24 hours before using them Industry Specications UL 746C
