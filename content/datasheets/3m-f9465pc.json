Tape with Plasticizer Resistant Adhesive F9465PC Product Description 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape F9465PC is an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive which has been formulated   for bonding to many exible vinyls and provide outstanding resistance to the eects of plasticizer migration   from exible vinyls 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape with Plasticizer Resistant Adhesive F9465PC General Information Note Vinyl formulations dier and plasticizer types and amounts can vary The most common types ofPlasticized Vinyl contain low molecular weight materials   plasticizers which tend to migrate out of the vinyl In the case of adhesive bonding, these plasticizers migrate into the adhesive which can cause softening of the   adhesive and loss of bond strength over time    The possible eect of plasticizer migration on an adhesive bond can be predicted by accelerated aging for 5 days at elevated temperature 150F 65C Note Due   to the variability of vinyl formulations, we strongly recommend that the user test each vinyl substrate to determine suitability of the tape for the particular application    Natural and synthetic rubber materials such as neoprene and EPDM are also formulated with llers and plasticizers Note 3M Adhesive Transfer Tape F9465PC   does not resist the eects of these particular llers and plasticizers and is not recommended for use in bonding these materials Technical
