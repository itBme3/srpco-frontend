The most common types ofPlasticized Vinyl contain low molecular weight materials   (plasticizers) which tend to migrate out of the vinyl. In the case of adhesive bonding, these plasticizers migrate into the adhesive which can cause softening of the   adhesive and loss of bond strength over time.   • The possible e\u0000ect of plasticizer migration on an adhesive bond can be predicted by accelerated aging for 5 days at elevated temperature (150°F [65°C]). Note: Due   to the variability of vinyl formulations, we strongly recommend that the user test each vinyl substrate to determine suitability of the tape for the particular application.   • Natural and synthetic rubber materials such as neoprene and EPDM are also formulated with \u0000llers and plasticizers. Note: 3M™ Adhesive Transfer Tape F-9465PC   does not resist the e\u0000ects of these particular \u0000llers and plasticizers and is not recommended for use in bonding these materials.

Typical Environmental Performance Environmental Resistance Bond Build-up: The bond strength of 3M™ Plasticizer Resistant Adhesive increases as a function of time and temperature   Temperature/Heat Resistance: 3M™ Plasticizer Resistant Adhesive is usable for short periods (minutes, hours) at temperatures up to 200°F (94°C) and for intermittent   longer periods (days, weeks) up to 160°F (71°C).   Lower Temperature Service Limit: -40°F (-40°C).   UV Resistance: When properly applied, parts are not adversely a\u0000ected by outdoor exposure. Handling/Application Information Application Examples • Attaching \u0000exible vinyl graphics to sporting helmets   • Attaching \u0000exible vinyl \u0000lms and graphics to signs   • Attaching \u0000exible vinyl graphics to vehicles   • Attaching \u0000exible vinyl graphics to collectibles   • Attaching \u0000exible vinyl tubing Storage and Shelf Life Store in original cartons at 70°F (21°C) and 50% relative humidity.
