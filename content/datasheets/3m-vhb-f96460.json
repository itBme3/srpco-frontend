This 3M™ VHB™ Adhesive Transfer Tape is transparent and is ideal for use in   many interior and exterior industrial applications to replace rivets, spot welds, liquid adhesives, and other   permanent fasteners. 3M™ VHB™ Adhesive Transfer Tape F9460PC Technical Information Note The following technical information and data should be considered representative or typical only and should not be used for speci\u0000cation purposes. Typical Physical Properties Property Values Method Total Tape Thickness 0.06 mm 2.3 mil ASTM D3652 Adhesive Type Acrylic Density 1.012 g/cm³ 0.04 lb/in³ Liner 58# Polycoated Kraft Liner Print 3M VHB Liner Thickness 0.106 mm 4.2 mil UL Listing 3M™ Adhesive 100MP has UL 746C listings with di\u0000erent temperature ratings on many commonly used substrate materials as indicated in the table below.   Quali\u0000cation for this listing requires high strength retention after extended exposure to high temperatures, humidity, cold, and cyclic conditions.   Substrates Temperature Rating   Stainless Steel, Glass/Epoxy, Enameled Steel, Ceramic, Phenolic: 110°C   ABS, Polycarbonate, Aluminum, Galvanized Steel: 90°C   Unplasticized PVC: 75°C Our testing has shown that 3M™ Adhesive 100MP yielded 92% retention of peel adhesion after the roll was aged for more than 5 years at an elevated temperature of   150°F (65°C). The initial tack and liner release properties were still excellent. This testing result suggests that the tape is relatively una\u0000ected by long-term exposure to   elevated temperatures. Bonds made with 3M™ Adhesive 100MP can tolerate periodic short-term exposures to temperatures up to 500°F (260°C).   3M™ Adhesive 100MP is thermoplastic in nature, becoming softer as temperature increases and \u0000rmer as temperature decreases. As the adhesive becomes \u0000rmer, the   performance generally increases. This performance increase is demonstrated graphically in Figure 1 for 3M™ VHB™ Adhesive Transfer Tape F9473PC. It shows the   breakaway and peel forces as a function of temperature. The exception of the performance increase is at very low temperatures when high impact stresses along with   high frequencies are encountered. At low temperatures, the tape becomes very \u0000rm and glassy; the ability to absorb impact energy is reduced. Dynamic Mechanical Properties For engineers who have to use adhesive properties for modeling and analysis purpose, we suggest a Young’s modulus of 4.5 × 102 kPA (measured at 23°C & 1 Hz) and   a Poisson’s ratio of 0.499. For detailed adhesive modulus and damping properties, please refer to the nomograph for 3M™ VHB™ Adhesive Transfer Tapes, which is   available upon request through our technical service group. The nomograph presents adhesive modulus and damping properties as functions of temperature and   frequency. 3M™ VHB™ Adhesive Transfer Tape F9460PC Typical Performance Characteristics Additional Test notes 3M™ VHB™ Adhesive Transfer Tapes F9460PC, F9469PC, and F9473PC are made from the same adhesive system and are thermoplastic in nature, becoming softer   as temperature increases and \u0000rmer as temperature decreases. As the adhesive becomes \u0000rmer, the adhesion performance generally increases. At low temperatures   (lower than -40°F [-40°C]), the 3M™ VHB™ Adhesive Transfer Tape becomes very \u0000rm and glassy; the ability to absorb impact energy is reduced. In contrast,   adhesion strength reduces with increasing temperatures. Typical adhesive strength properties at room temperatures are shown below. Solvent Resistance No apparent degradation when exposed to splash testing of many common solvents and \u0000uids including gasoline, JP-4 fuel, mineral spirits, motor oil, ammonia   cleaner, acetone and methyl ethyl ketone.   (3 splash testing cycles: 20 seconds submersion, & 20 seconds air dry.)

The results are reported as   percentage of total mass loss (TML) and percentage of   Volatile Condensible Materials (VCM), respectively, as   shown below. Handling/Application Information Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and improve   bond strength.   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry, and well uni\u0000ed. Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol/water mixture or   heptane.*   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory.   *Note: Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use when using solvents.
