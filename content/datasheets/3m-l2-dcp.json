Lower Service Temperature: -40°F (-40°C)   Humidity Resistance: High humidity has minimal e\u0000ect on adhesive performance. No signi\u0000cant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for 7 days at   90°F (32°C) and 90% relative humidity. Handling/Application Information Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesive-to-surface contact developed. Firm pressure during application will assist the adhesive in developing   intimate contact with the bonding surface.   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry, and well uni\u0000ed. Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane.*   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too \u0000rm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory. Storage and Shelf Life Store in original cartons at 70°F (21°C) and 50% relative humidity.   If stored under proper conditions, product retains its performance and properties for 24 months from the date of manufacture.
