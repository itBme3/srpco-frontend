Environmental Resistance Temperature Resistance The L2 adhesive family is usable for short periods minutes, hours at temperatures up to 225F 107C and for intermittent longer periods of   time days, weeks up to 170F 77C   Lower Service Temperature 40F 40C   Humidity Resistance High humidity has minimal eect on adhesive performance No signicant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for 7 days at   90F 32C and 90 relative humidity HandlingApplication Information Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm pressure during application will assist the adhesive in developing   intimate contact with the bonding surface   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry, and well unied Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory Storage and Shelf Life Store in original cartons at 70F 21C and 50 relative humidity   If stored under proper conditions, product retains its performance and properties for 24 months from the date of manufacture References Property Values
