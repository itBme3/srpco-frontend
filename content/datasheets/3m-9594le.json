considered representative or typical only and should not be used for specification purposes  2   3  3M  High Strength Double Coated Tape with Adhesive 300LSE 9594LE  9594LEB Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100F 38C to 130F 54C, will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unified Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane  Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too firm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory  When using solvents, extinguish all ignition sources, including pilot lights, and follow the manufacturers precautions and directions for use These cleaning recommendations may not be compliant with the rules of certain Air Quality Management Districts in California consult applicable rules before use Environmental Performance Humidity Resistance  High humidity has minimal effect on adhesive performance  No significant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for 7 days at 90F 32C and 90 relative humidity UV Resistance  When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely affected by exposure Water Resistance  Immersion in water has no appreciable effect on the bond strength After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained Temperature Cycling Resistance  High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through 4 hours at 158F 70C 4 hours at 20F 29C 4 hours at 73F 22C Chemical Resistance  When  properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids and alkalis General purpose steel rule diecutting 58 PCK Steel rule cutting many nameplates on common sheet 83 PCK Kiss cutting, steel rule 83 PCK Rotary diecutting PET Selective diecutting

leaving adhesive diecuts dispensable from the 4994 densified kraft liner 2  Rotary processing for finished parts If a densified kraft DK liner is necessary, the adhesive should be first laminated to the substrate with pressure After lamination, remove the 58 PCK liner and laminate the outside of the 4994 DK liner Adding Liners for 3M  Double Coated Tapes with Adhesive 300LSE Application Ideas   Foam to powder coated painted surfaces   Low surface energy plastic adhesion Storage Store in original cartons at 70F 21C and 50 relative humidity Shelf Life If stored under proper conditions, product retains its performance and properties for two years from date of manufacture Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable
