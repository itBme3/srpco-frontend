Firm application pressure and moderate heat, from 100°F (38°C) to 130°F (54°C), will assist the adhesive in developing intimate contact with the bonding surface. To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry and well unified. Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcohol or heptane. * Ideal tape application temperature range is 70°F to 100°F (21°C to 38°C). Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) is not recommended because the adhesive becomes too firm to adhere readily. However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory. * When using solvents, extinguish all ignition sources, including pilot lights, and follow the manufacturer’s precautions and directions for use. These cleaning recommendations may not be compliant with the rules of certain Air Quality Management Districts in California; consult applicable rules before use. Environmental Performance Humidity Resistance:  High humidity has minimal effect on adhesive performance.  No significant reduction in bond strength is observed after exposure for 7 days at 90°F (32°C) and 90% relative humidity. UV Resistance:  When properly applied, nameplates and decorative trim parts are not adversely affected by exposure. Water Resistance:  Immersion in water has no appreciable effect on the bond strength. After 100 hours at room temperature, the high bond strength is maintained. Temperature Cycling Resistance:  High bond strength is maintained after cycling four times through: 4 hours at 158°F (70°C) 4 hours at -20°F (-29°C) 4 hours at 73°F (22°C) Chemical Resistance:  When  properly applied, nameplate and decorative trim parts will hold securely after exposure to numerous chemicals including oil, mild acids and alkalis.

Rotary processing, tape only, on a densified (outside of #4994) kraft liner. In this process, the tape waste will stay with the 58# PCK liner, leaving adhesive die-cuts dispensable from the #4994 (densified kraft) liner. 2.  Rotary processing for finished parts. If a densified kraft (DK) liner is necessary, the adhesive should be first laminated to the substrate with pressure. After lamination, remove the 58# PCK liner and laminate the outside of the #4994 (DK) liner. Adding Liners for 3M ™ Double Coated Tapes with Adhesive 300LSE Application Ideas •  Foam to powder coated painted surfaces. •  Low surface energy plastic adhesion. Storage Store in original cartons at 70°F (21°C) and 50% relative humidity. Shelf Life If stored under proper conditions, product retains its performance and properties for two years from date of manufacture. Application Equipment To apply adhesives in a wide web format, lamination equipment is required to ensure acceptable quality. To learn more about working with pressure-sensitive adhesives please refer to technical bulletin, Lamination Techniques for Converters of Laminating Adhesives (70-0704-1430-8).
