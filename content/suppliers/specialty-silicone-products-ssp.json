(SSP) supplies electrically-conductive silicone elastomers that provide shielding against electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI). Many of the particle-filled silicones that SSP has developed meet the MIL-DTL-83528C specification for military applications. Commercial-grade materials are available for automotive, aerospace, satellite communications, unmanned systems, and other electronic applications that require EMI and RFI suppression.</p>\n<h4><strong>Military and Aerospace Silicones</strong></h4>\n<p>Specialty Silicone Products Inc. (SSP) supplies high-purity platinum cure and peroxide cure silicones that meet specific application requirements.Since 1989, SSP has formulated and manufactured more than 1,000 different silicone compounds to meet the needs of clients in various industries, including aerospace and defense.</p>\n<h4><strong>Platinum Cure Silicone Elastomers</strong></h4>\n<p>SSP-2390 is a series of ultra-clean, platinum-catalyzed, heat-cured silicone elastomers that are available in various durometers (Shore A). Platinum cured silicone rubber has stronger physical properties and lower shrinkage values than peroxide cure compounds, and does not produce offgassing or catalyst byproducts. SSP’s platinum cure silicones are cost-effective, and combine high-purity with FDA, USP Class VI*, and RoHS compliance.</p>\n","order":6,"description":"SSP has a reputation for developing “Silicones that Work” and delivering them to customers with speed, flexibility, and service.","type":"supplier","collectionType":"suppliers","totalConverters":null,"color":"blue_500","media":{"id":230,"name":"ssp@2x.jpg","alternativeText":"ssp@2x.jpg","caption":"ssp@2x.jpg","width":1200,"height":1200,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_ssp@2x.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_ssp_2x_0d61622a72","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":156,"height":156,"size":2.92,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_ssp_2x_0d61622a72.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_ssp@2x.jpg","hash":"large_ssp_2x_0d61622a72","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":1000,"size":36.38,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/large_ssp_2x_0d61622a72.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_ssp@2x.jpg","hash":"medium_ssp_2x_0d61622a72","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":750,"size":23.39,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/medium_ssp_2x_0d61622a72.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_ssp@2x.jpg","hash":"small_ssp_2x_0d61622a72","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":500,"size":12.59,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_ssp_2x_0d61622a72.jpg"}},"hash":"ssp_2x_0d61622a72","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":34.65,"url":"/uploads/ssp_2x_0d61622a72.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2022-02-28T05:26:22.912Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-13T07:15:20.350Z"},"seo":{"id":3203,"title":"Specialty Silicone Products (SSP)","description":"SSP has a reputation for developing “Silicones that Work” and delivering them to customers with speed, flexibility, and service.","image":{"id":230,"name":"ssp@2x.jpg","alternativeText":"ssp@2x.jpg","caption":"ssp@2x.jpg","width":1200,"height":1200,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_ssp@2x.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_ssp_2x_0d61622a72","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":156,"height":156,"size":2.92,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_ssp_2x_0d61622a72.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_ssp@2x.jpg","hash":"large_ssp_2x_0d61622a72","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":1000,"size":36.38,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/large_ssp_2x_0d61622a72.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_ssp@2x.jpg","hash":"medium_ssp_2x_0d61622a72","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":750,"size":23.39,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/medium_ssp_2x_0d61622a72.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_ssp@2x.jpg","hash":"small_ssp_2x_0d61622a72","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":500,"size":12.59,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_ssp_2x_0d61622a72.jpg"}},"hash":"ssp_2x_0d61622a72","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":34.65,"url":"/uploads/ssp_2x_0d61622a72.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2022-02-28T05:26:22.912Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-13T07:15:20.350Z"}},"blocks":[],"pageSettings":null,"id":46}
