Technical Data Sheet  Acrylic Foam Tape  RT8000  Series      General Information         The acrylic Foam Tape RT8000 Series, which is made by  a special process, has a superior adhesion performance    and high flexibility This tape is specially designed for ex terior and interior parts attachments of automobiles    The Acrylic Foam Tape can work well on the TOYOTA  Anti Acid Paint and Scratch Resistant Paint      Features    To the TOYOTA Anti Acid Rain Pa int and Scratch Resistant Paint surface  a Meets the TOYOTA specification of The pressure  sensitive adhesive double coated t ape for exterior parts, and      has a superior initial adhesion performance and durability  b Has the same workability as the  standard type on the conventional paint  c Doesnt detach from the paint surface bec ause of a superior stress relaxation properties  d Still has a superior adhesion performance on the convent ional paint surface, and can be used for the same      applications as the standar d type acrylic foam tape  Follows the shrinkage and elongation of the plastic par t caused by the temperature change, and has good stress    relaxation properties which are very import ant for the

It was a different country, culture, currency, language, and a different way of doing business. Not to mention the 15-hour flight, with a 13-hour time difference. From the time we decided China would be a good fit for SRP, until the day the doors opened was a little over a year. During that year we would come to find solutions to the hardships in which we feared from the beginning. SRP’s owners and managers were determined to make the best of this second location by hiring an Asian business consultant to help us navigate through the complexity of licensing a company in China. We decided against becoming a joint venture, and instead became an LLC.

Polycarbonate, Aluminum, Galvanized Steel 90C   Unplasticized PVC 75C Our testing has shown that 3M Adhesive 100MP yielded 92 retention of peel adhesion after the roll was aged for more than 5 years at an elevated temperature of   150F 65C The initial tack and liner release properties were still excellent This testing result suggests that the tape is relatively unaected by longterm exposure to   elevated temperatures Bonds made with 3M Adhesive 100MP can tolerate periodic shortterm exposures to temperatures up to 500F 260C   3M Adhesive 100MP is thermoplastic in nature, becoming softer as temperature increases and rmer as temperature decreases As the adhesive becomes rmer, the   performance generally increases This performance increase is demonstrated graphically in Figure 1 for 3M VHB Adhesive Transfer Tape F9473PC It shows the   breakaway and peel forces as a function of temperature The exception of the performance increase is at very low temperatures when high impact stresses along with   high frequencies are encountered At low temperatures, the tape becomes very rm and glassy the ability to absorb impact energy is reduced Dynamic Mechanical Properties For engineers who have to use adhesive properties for modeling and analysis purpose, we suggest a Youngs modulus of 45  102 kPA measured at 23C  1 Hz and   a Poissons ratio of 0499 For detailed adhesive modulus and

Volatile Condensible Materials VCM, respectively, as   shown below HandlingApplication Information Application Techniques Bond strength is dependent upon the amount of adhesivetosurface contact developed Firm application pressure helps develop better adhesive contact and improve   bond strength   To obtain optimum adhesion, the bonding surfaces must be clean, dry, and well unied Some typical surface cleaning solvents are isopropyl alcoholwater mixture or   heptane   Ideal tape application temperature range is 70F to 100F 21C to 38C Initial tape application to surfaces at temperatures below 50F 10C is not recommended   because the adhesive becomes too rm to adhere readily However, once properly applied, low temperature holding is generally satisfactory   Note Be sure to follow the
