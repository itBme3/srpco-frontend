These materials are strong and flexible having a high tensile strength, flexibility, durability and dimensional stability. Premium plastics and film products have low shrinkage, low moisture absorption, good dielectric properties and high thermal resistance.SRP typically converts plastic and film materials ranging from .001” to .125” thick. However, when utilizing our waterjet, we can cut plastic up to .250” thick and maintaining tight tolerances.Plastic and film materials are cut per our customers specifications, and can be supplied with a pressure sensitive adhesive.Common Plastic MaterialsFormex™ PolypropylenePOREX® PTFETeflon® PTFEPolyethylene (PET)Common Film MaterialsKapton® PolyimideMelinex® Polyester (PET)Mylar® Polyester (PET)Lexan™ PolycarbonateValox™ PolybutyleneRigid Vinyl PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) &nbsp;SRP: Building Relationships through Converting Solutions Since 1951We provide our customers with everything from material sampling and product prototyping to full manufacturing, packaging, and delivery.
