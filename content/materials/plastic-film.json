These materials are strong and flexible having a high tensile strength, flexibility, durability and dimensional stability. Premium plastics and film products have low shrinkage, low moisture absorption, good dielectric properties and high thermal resistance.</p>\n<p>SRP typically converts plastic and film materials ranging from .001” to .125” thick. However, when utilizing our waterjet, we can cut plastic up to .250” thick and maintaining tight tolerances.</p>\n<p>Plastic and film materials are cut per our customers specifications, and can be supplied with a pressure sensitive adhesive.</p>\n<h4>Common Plastic Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Formex™ Polypropylene</li>\n<li>POREX® PTFE</li>\n<li>Teflon® PTFE</li>\n<li>Polyethylene (PET)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Common Film Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Kapton® Polyimide</li>\n<li>Melinex® Polyester (PET)</li>\n<li>Mylar® Polyester (PET)</li>\n<li>Lexan™ Polycarbonate</li>\n<li>Valox™ Polybutylene</li>\n<li>Rigid Vinyl PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride)<strong> </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">SRP</span>: Building Relationships through Converting Solutions Since 1951</h3>\n<p>We provide our customers with everything from material sampling and product prototyping to full manufacturing, packaging, and delivery.
