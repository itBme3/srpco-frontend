Our top of the line custom laminating system is the best in the industry. The majority of the products we make are custom fabricated with adhesive lamination one one or both sides of the substrate. There are three primary adhesive groups: Silicone, Acrylic, and Rubber based.Foam Tapes are available in a variety of thicknesses, adhesives, carriers and sizes. Custom Foam tapes are designed to enhance the appearance and improve the overall performance of your product design. The benefits of using Custom Foam Tape include: Sealing, Cushioning, Vibration Damping, Impact Resistance, and withstands wide temperature ranges to bond to rough or irregular surfaces in permanent or repositionable applications.We work directly with adhesive companies such as 3M, Avery, CCT, MacTac and Adchem. We have created fabulous relationships with our adhesive suppliers. This allows us to work closely with them to be able to choose the optimum solution for our customers. Our engineers will work with you to determine the best fit adhesive to your application.&nbsp;SRP: Building Relationships through Converting Solutions Since 1951We provide our customers with everything from material sampling and product prototyping to full manufacturing, packaging, and delivery. We provide value to our customers by delivering exceptional customer service, engineering solutions, and quality products to meet their every need.For more information, you can reach SRP at info@srpco.com or 847-593-5630.","description":"SRP provides adhesive laminating services for adhesive backed products that can be converted into custom gaskets and seals.","order":null,"type":"material","collectionType":"materials","media":{"id":184,"name":"black_rubber_ring-11web.jpg","alternativeText":"Custom Adhesive backed Gasket","caption":"uploads/2017/07/black_rubber_ring-11web.jpg","width":1075,"height":1062,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_black_rubber_ring-11web.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":158,"height":156,"size":3.72,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_black_rubber_ring-11web.jpg","hash":"large_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":988,"size":62.6,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/large_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_black_rubber_ring-11web.jpg","hash":"medium_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":741,"size":34.9,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/medium_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_black_rubber_ring-11web.jpg","hash":"small_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":494,"size":16.53,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62.jpg"}},"hash":"black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":72.98,"url":"/uploads/black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2022-01-23T22:48:57.437Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-13T07:15:20.209Z"},"seo":{"id":3197,"title":"Pressure Sensitive Adhesive","description":"SRP provides adhesive laminating services for adhesive backed products that can be converted into custom gaskets and seals.","image":{"id":184,"name":"black_rubber_ring-11web.jpg","alternativeText":"Custom Adhesive backed Gasket","caption":"uploads/2017/07/black_rubber_ring-11web.jpg","width":1075,"height":1062,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_black_rubber_ring-11web.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":158,"height":156,"size":3.72,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_black_rubber_ring-11web.jpg","hash":"large_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":988,"size":62.6,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/large_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_black_rubber_ring-11web.jpg","hash":"medium_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":741,"size":34.9,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/medium_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_black_rubber_ring-11web.jpg","hash":"small_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":494,"size":16.53,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62.jpg"}},"hash":"black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":72.98,"url":"/uploads/black_rubber_ring_11web_0705175a62.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2022-01-23T22:48:57.437Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-13T07:15:20.209Z"}},"blocks":[],"pageSettings":null,"gaskets":[{"id":49,"title":"Pressure Sensitive Adhesives","createdAt":"2022-01-23T22:50:09.244Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-23T09:45:56.398Z","publishedAt":"2017-08-28T14:09:25.000Z","slug":"adhesives-tapes","content":"<p>A Pressure Sensitive Adhesive (PSA) is a permanently tacky substance that adheres to a given surface when light pressure is applied.
